The organisation is an expression of a strong commitment to teaching, and a strong belief in the power of science to reach out across all kinds of boundaries of nationality and belief.

These activities strongly support scientific education and training and may help generate interest in pursuing a career in science, especially for students that do not have frequent access to diverse scientific offers though schools, academia or industry. Thus, we were glad to be able to contribute to this inititative that increases awareness and interest for a broad and diverse range of scientific and technical topis among students.

I have participated twice in the school and I must to say that both times were extraordinary. S3 is not a simple science camp, it’s special: there you can not only immerse yourself in interesting and challenging projects and learn lots of new things but also what I really love about S3 is that you get the opportunity to meet like – minded people and spend your free time with peers coming from various countries, who are all diverse but at the same time united by passion for science. The advice and interesting chats with the most amazing project/swapshop leaders, organizers and incredible lecturers as well as various adventures and new friends make S3 truly unique. I’m happy I got an opportunity to participate! </em> <br>

                      <em> The Summer School of Science 2019 exceeded all of my expectations. Ten days flew by like a second. Ten days of learning, working, enjoying good food and knowledge, talking, playing games, experimenting... In just ten days I feel like a different person. Coming in the first day you never know what to expect, meeting all these different people from different cultural backgrounds, it's overwhelming yet at the end, you come out with friends for life. It was wonderful seeing how everyone united for science. Meeting like-minded science enthusiast and talking for hours on end. Silent times when everyone was fully focused on the task at hand. Challenging moments when we had to work as a team and come up with ideas. Eating pizza with all the project leaders. Feeling like a super cool scientist. Late-night lectures from scientists in every field. Having conversations with these scientists. Laughing, singing, dancing. In ten days I feel like I have a better understanding of the world I live in, I feel even more motivated to pursue science. It was a perfect blend of hard work and fun. I wish I could do it all over again.</em> <br>

                      <em> It's been the first time for me to participate in such international science camp and I can tell you that I wasn't the only one. At the beginning it was a bit difficult to get used to the strict working schedule and to the absolutely high-level work; at least 8 hours of work on the specific project each day, not much freetime. However, it turned out to be super cool and was easy to handle the amount and quality of work as we've made more and more progress in our projects, and as we've become good friends and teammates. We also had to hold some presentations based on our projects both midway and at the end, which sounds challenging and is, but I think we can be really satisfied with and can be proud of those presentations indeed. We've always had some activities in the evening, either social activities (International evening, treasure hunt or pub quiz) or lectures on fascinating topics held by prominent scientists. All in all, the knowledge and experience I've gained, the whole environment and the working progress made me even more motivated to become a scientist and gave me a brand-new mindset. If interested, give it a go, it'll pay back multiple times. </em> <br>

In addition to all of the really interesting projects and lectures, I had the opportunity to know many brilliant and nice people, both students and project leaders. Maybe you think that 10 days is a bit too much but I can assure you that everyone I met there would have been enthusiastic to stay there more than those 10 days.

Working on a project there is amazing because it gives you a perfect blend of theoretical and practical knowledge on a subject you may not have known a lot about before, but it also lets you meet people whose interests are similar to yours and it permits you to ask and test out whatever questions and ideas might come to mind, no matter how silly you think they are.</em> <br>
