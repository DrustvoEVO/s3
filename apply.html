                            All applications will be reviewed by the school organizers and a certain number of applicants will be selected for <b>interviews</b>. Please, check regularly your e-mails to ensure that you got the response. We will let you know about outcome in both cases, being selected or excluded from the interviews. The advantage is given to students who can benefit the most from the School (eg. they have never participated in something similar before), since usually there are more good applicants than available places. Therefore, it is of great importance to write a good <b>motivation letter</b>! Interviews will be conducted by Skype, this year mid June. Students will be notified by e-mail about the exact time of the interview. During interviews, we focus on wide range of topics (not necessarily science), assess student's proficiency in English and his/her personal motivation. Final selection will be announced in the following week. <br /><br />
                            We believe that each applicant who has expressed an interest in science should be given the opportunity to develop professionally. However, due to  lack of  resources, we cannot place all  interested students in one of our camps. Therefore, if you were not selected, it doesn't mean  you were not good enough and you can <b>always try next year</b>. We  still want to maintain contact with you and to offer you  guidance when neded.

The fee covers accommodation, food, excursion costs and regular antigen Covid testing. Students have to cover their own travel expenses which might also contain additional PCR Covid testing.

                            The fee for participants in higher categories reflects the real economic cost of the participation. Thanks to our sponsors, we have managed to reduce one part of the fees in year 2022: those for participants coming from Category I (lower income) countries. However, we are constantly working to find new sponsors in order to further reduce the fee for all participants. If we succeed we will announce new, reduced fee amounts on this website prior to the beginning of the camp. Also, please note that we function inside a non-profit organization and all our mentors work <em>pro bono</em>, so we do not run a profit on the School. We invite all interested donors to <a href="index.html#contact"><strong><font color="white">contact us</font></strong></a>.

                            To help pay the fee, we encourage students to find a sponsor (your school, town or a company; international applicants can also try their embassy). There are several scholarships available each year. Please see the text below for more information.

                        To qualify, you must include a separate letter in your application, explaining the economic situation of your family. This year we are able to give several scholarships to students who need them the most. A few scholarships are provided by the Society for Out-of-Frame Education.

                        Additionaly, as of 2018 Dominik "Dino" Knežević Scholarship is also available this year for several students. The priority is given to students of Matija Mesić Gymnasium in Slavonski Brod, Croatia. In case there are no successful candidates from that Gymnasium, it will be awarded to other students from Croatia or abroad, according to the criterion of need. You can find more details <a href='files/StipendijaDominikKnezevic_2019.pdf'><strong>here</strong></a> (in Croatian).

                            Finding a sponsor can seem like a daunting task, especially if you have never tried it before. However, it can provide a lot of benefits. You will get training in fundraising, an important skill for students and scientists, who often have to find financing for their projects, studies or travel to conferences.
                        </p>
                        <p class="main2">   
                            In order to find a sponsor, consider both big and small, local, national and international companies. Examples are: banks, state or private companies (especially those which benefit from research and development, like those in the pharmaceutical industry), government structures (schools, your city or county, embassy) or non-governmental institutions. Some of them give donations on a regular basis with competitions with fixed deadlines. In your request, you should include a one-page letter explaining your demand and why the School would be good for your education and career. Include the reasons why you are applying to them. We encourage you to add your CV and a Letter of Support, which we can send you.

                        The principal aim of <strong>Summer School of Science</strong> is to gather people with professional interests in science and technology, and to provide them with practical experience according to our possibilities. Since only about 40 participants can be admitted each year (around 20 per camp), the organizers select those students who will benefit the most from participation. During the<strong> <a href="#process">selection process</a></strong>,  they will examine each student's background and motivation through the motivational letter and a Skype interview. Thus, it is of uttermost importance to write a good motivational letter, explaining your future goals and interests. The letter is a way for the organizers to get to know you and understand the reasons why you want to participate.<br />
