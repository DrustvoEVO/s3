                        </h3>

                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2021/Elia - project.jpg" width="270" hspace="9" align="right" />
                            Imagine a very advanced alien civilization, observing the universe for the past million
                            years or so. Our tiny rock we call home is of little interest to them. After all, the
                            dominant life-form on this blue planet, some monkeys that recently started to wear
                            shoes, has not even entered into interstellar contact. Because of this, the alien scientists
                            are rather brief when it comes to us, and their three-word summary of humanity
                            on planet earth reads as follows: hunting - farming - factories. Now, I’d like to draw
                            your attention to the duration of these periods: it took about 50.000 years before
                            people got tired of running after their food. Then, it took us another 10.000 years of
                            farming until the industrial revolution 200 years ago changed the world once again,
                            more or less to the state it is in today. Even the aliens, unimpressed as they may be,
                            cannot deny that our progress is at least accelerating dramatically.</p>

                        <p class="project">Why is this? Well, it is certainly not because humans today are inherently smarter
                            or more skilled than their ancestors. For example, the ancient Greeks did absolutely
                            brilliant mathematics, but at the same time, they also never managed to build a
                            toaster. Clearly, being smart is necessary (we do need maths), but not sufficient (we
                            also do like toasters). The true driving force behind our spectacular acceleration is
                            information. In particular, our ability to transfer information over time and space
                            has grown tremendously. Book printing and the internet are two major milestones in
                            this regard. This means knowledge became available to more people, faster, which in
                            turn meant that new ideas were generated faster, by more people, which then also got
                            transferred faster, and so on. This self-amplifying process is what drives humankind’s
                            ever faster progress.</p>

                        <p class="project">This project is a testimony to that central point. Based on knowledge freely
                            available on the internet, an intelligent teenager today is perfectly capable of understanding
                            the maths, physics and computer science necessary to understand and use
                            a quantum computer. If you stop and think about that for a moment, I hope you’ll
                            realize that that is quite something indeed.</p>
                        
                        <p class="project">Concretely, the end goal of this project is twofold. First, we will work towards
                            a fairly deep understanding of what computation really is, because we need that to
                            see how, why and where quantum computation could make a fundamental difference.
                            Second, we will learn how to write code for such quantum computers in general, and
                            in particular, we’ll even try to do some machine learning, making such quantum computers
                            learn patterns in data. In order to do so, we’ll have a look at 17<sup>th</sup> century
                            maths (basic calculus and algebra), 20<sup>th</sup> century physics (quantum mechanics) and
                            lastly, 21<sup>st</sup> century computer science (artificial intelligence). Such an effort of collecting,
                            sharing, using, and improving knowledge constitutes the core of what we call
                            science. Not even 15 years ago, this project would have been borderline impossible,
                            today all you need is a curious mind, an internet connection and (perhaps) some
                            minor guidance, all of which are in ample supply at S<sup>3</sup>.</p>

                        It is well-known that all living organisms are made of small cells, but nonetheless, they contain a big amount of information. There are many different approaches we can use to explore these little structures, from microscopic observation to the most sensitive molecular analyses. Although there is no life without cells, altered cells can also lead to cancer. What is happening with these cells at the molecular level and how evolution and bioinformatics help in decryption hidden by the nucleotide transcript? We most often encounter evolutionary questions in the light of processes that have lasted for millions of years, but we are also surrounded by those that, compared to the duration of the human lifespan, are extremely short, such as the evolution of bacteria or, in this case,  DNA sequence. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="project">In this project, we will zoom in on the field of research and even get to molecular evolution. We will see how the process of evolution flows on this scale and how it can be useful in cancer research. As for the most experimental research, we will need a laboratory, but this time it will be in your computer. Now that we have armed ourselves with good internet connection we can open the door of the virtual laboratory. Working on this project you will try yourself in the role of a molecular and evolution biologist. You will conduct your virtual experiment and process the obtained data using different bioinformatic tools.</p>

                    <p class="project">On this journey, we will embark from the laboratory where we will learn what the work with cell culture looks like, what it takes to isolate DNA from cells and what it requires to be done in order to get a multiplied material which we can later experimentally manipulate. After that, we will become acquainted with the process which allows us to read DNA sequence and with the importance of the information that is written in our DNA. You will have the opportunity to analyze various sequences in silico, build up dendrograms and later use them to provide answers regarding the evolution processes in the cell. </p>

                    Have you ever wondered how the machines around you function? Have you ever wondered how these machines were designed? What is a machine in the first place? It’s no surprise that companies are trying to come up with unique products and solutions. According to tendency and statistics, we use our devices and machines less and less before eventually replacing it with a new and innovative model. And as the life expectancy of our machines decrease, so must the designing process accelerate. </p>

                <p class="project">In this project, we will design a machine and use an advanced software to create a 3D model. In order to test the limits of your new product and check for potentially dangerous sections, we will use Finite Element Analysis to make your machine operate safely. The main goal of every design process however is to produce an accurate drawing, based upon which your design can be called to life – as such, we will strive for the same. </p>

            <h3><strong><a name="p1" id="p1"></a>Designing a better drug: crystal structure investigation</strong>
            </h3>

            <p class="project"><img src="img/2021/Nea i Edi - project.png" width="270" hspace="9" align="right" />
                Pharmaceutical drugs help to alleviate troublesome conditions and to improve the quality of life for billions of people around the world. However, the path from the drawn structure of the active molecule to the usable drug form is as complex as one could imagine. Many obstacles have to be resolved before producing a safe and effective medicine. One of the greatest is the properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API): it has to be chemically stable over a long period of time, have sufficient solubility in bodily fluids and have adequate physical properties for manufacturing of final dosage forms on the large scale.</p>

            <p class="project">All of the aforementioned properties are a direct consequence of the crystal structure of the APIs. By modifying the crystal structure, i.e. by introducing a helper species, one can design material of the same or better pharmaceutical value, albeit with superior physical and chemical properties. Examples of these include single-drug crystals like ibuprofen L-lysinate, ertugliflozin/5-oxoproline, or multi-drug crystals like tramadol/celecoxib, valsartan/sacubitril etc.</p>

            <p class="project">However, that modification is easier said than done! Finding the optimal helper species is far from a routine job: one has to execute a screening experiment, or in other words try thousands of experimental conditions and helper species to maybe find a single hit. Consequently, these efforts would benefit greatly from an in silico pre-screening candidate selection and feasibility study.</p>
        
            <p class="project">In this project, you will design and test an algorithm for determining the best combinations of APIs and helper species, based on crystal structure data kindly provided by the CCDC Crystal Structure Database. You will learn about intermolecular interactions and their consequences on the arrangement of molecules in space, and how that does affect the properties of the materials.  The final goal of this project is to develop a knowledge base and a framework for the virtual screening of multi-component API crystals.</p>

                                   When we think about our emotions, we can probably imagine how we can feel various emotions in the same day – from sadness, anger and boredom to excitement, happiness and interest. Likewise, when we look at our mood during the week, we could say that on some days we generally feel better and on some days we feel worse. Psychological studies show that the rhythm of our mood varies during the week and during the day in a sinusoidal manner. <br><br>In this workshop we will measure our mood during one week by filling out a short mood questionnaire called PANAS. We will use the obtained data to conduct sinusoidal regression, which we will use to try to detect our own daily and weekly mood rhythms. We will compare our data to the data of previous studies on this topic.<br/><br/>

                                   Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star in the constellation of Orion and it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, usually sitting comfortably among the top ten brightest we can see. However, in late 2019 and early 2020, its brightness started to drop steeply and seemingly for no reason. At its dimmest, it dropped outside the top 20 on the list of brightest stars. This unprecedented dimming brought about a range of discussions about its cause, including talk of a potential supernova.<br><br>
                                    In this swapshop, we will explore stellar evolution and astronomical methods for measuring the temperature, size and composition of stars. We will use this information and data collected during Betelgeuse’s dimming to discuss possible (and probable) causes and decide whether we should worry about Orion’s shoulder going <i>boom</i>.<br/><br/>

                                   The crazy notion of cutting and opening an organism's body was considered madness in the past, but today is a go-to scientific method in studying internal anatomy and physiology of creatures. Through shapes of different organs, tissues and body parts we can observe and learn incredible amounts of information about animals’ behavior, diet, ways of reproducing and habitat they live in. Through internal anatomy scientists can analyze adaptations of organs and organ systems through different species on an evolutionary tree, providing them with deeper understanding of ways body works. Getting the technique right in the beginning allows biologists to use this method in different situations and adapt to different species. <br><br>
                                   We will play a role of crazy scientists and dissect some insects, worms and some other animals to observe their anatomy and physiology. We will learn how to prepare, put to sleep, dissect specimens under principles of bioethics. Information that we get from our specimens will be used to observe development of certain organ systems through the evolutionary tree. We will also learn about different adaptations some organisms have. This swapshop will provide students with experience in using different tools and appliances found in a lab, dealing with complex topics in easy ways and most importantly improvisation.<br/><br/>

How can we isolate it from a cell? How can we confirm the presence of DNA molecule in a tube? What are the questions we can ask and what answers can we get from reading sequences or from other analyses with this molecule? Can we multiple our sample and why managing that would be important for us too?<br><br>
									Workshop participants will have the opportunity to isolate DNA from bacterial cells. We will visualize our samples and see how DNA can become a simple strip on an agarose gel with the help of an electric field. Through discussion, we will get to know the basics of a PCR reaction and why it is revolutionary. Using bioinformatics tools, we are going to design some of the components needed for PCR reaction. Finally, with the help of computer simulation, we will go through all the steps and discover our results.<br/><br/>

                                   Electricity is one of those things taken for granted these days, along with household appliances, but have you ever wondered what makes this system work? Surely you have seen pictures of old windmills and water wheel mills designed to harness the power of wind or water and use it to perform work, and this is actually exactly the same as the way we produce electricity nowadays. In fact, what makes all your appliances run is the power of a river (or a heated steam stream) pushing against a turbine somewhere far away. In this workshop we will build a primitive electric generator and an electric motor and examine the way they work to see up close the process so ubiquitous in our everyday lives. Through discussion we will recreate the thought that went into designing various household appliances and see the many ways to use electric power. We will also get creative on the turbine-spinning side of the system and show how many different ways there are to get a wheel spinning.<br/><br/>
