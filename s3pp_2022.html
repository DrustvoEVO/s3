			 <h3><strong><a name="p1" id="p1"></a>Explaining source code to computers: helping them help us</strong><br/></h3>

                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2020/Marko_project.jpg"  height="170" hspace="9" align="right" />People use programming languages to talk to computers---mostly to boss them around and give them repetitive tasks to execute. However, computers cannot execute instructions written in high-level languages like C++, Java or Python directly---their processors can only execute very simple machine code. To help them out, we use a typically rather complex program called a compiler which reads high-level source code and translates it into low-level machine code. While enormous compilers like gcc are monumental achievements of the community with millions of lines of code and hundreds of contributors, smaller compilers or interpreters for simple, but useful languages can be written by a handful of enthusiastic people during a really cool summer school.

                        </p>

                        <p class="project"> In this project, we are going to investigate a wide variety of programming languages as use cases for some of the most important program compilation and interpretation stages, including lexing, parsing and evaluation. After an initial short presentation of Python and relevant topics in theoretical Computer Science, reading and programming assignments will be handed out dependent on complexity and team size. The general plan is to code up interpreters for simple languages with very different purposes, including, time permitting, our own custom-built languages. The student will learn how to read and/or write a specification for a language as well as syntactically and semantically analyse source code written in the language.

			 <h3><strong><a name="p2" id="p2"></a>To fold or not to fold? RNA structure and function</strong><br/></h3>

                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2021/Lukas_project.png"  height="170" hspace="9" align="right" />
According to the central dogma of molecular biology, RNA is often considered to be “just” the messenger of the genetic information between DNA to proteins. But RNA is not just some “wiggly” noodle floating in the cytoplasm. It can do much more, it also supplies the amino acids for translation (tRNA), catalyzes chemical reactions (rRNA, ribozymes) as well as regulates various pathways in the cell (miRNA, siRNA, sncRNA). In fact, RNA can do anything! And it is not only the sequence, but similarly to proteins, also the structure that matters. 


                        </p>

                        <p class="project">In this project, we will focus on the RNA structure and its functional 
consequences. First, we are going to employ several RNA structure 
prediction algorithms in order to verify their accuracy by comparing 
with the known RNA elements from the literature. Once we have done that 
and gained some experience, we will be able to look for specific 
elements within various RNA sequences, including human genes, tRNAs or viral genomes. After all of this, you would have learned what is the connection between RNA structure and its function with a little bit of 
coding as well. </p>

			 <h3><strong><a name="p3" id="p3"></a> Catching cancer culprits by their DNA fingertips </strong><br/></h3>

                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2021/Paula_project.png"  height="170" hspace="9" align="right" />
Our genomes are constantly suffering damage from factors outside the cell, such as environmental factors, or from harmful molecules produced by normal cell metabolism. Cells are often not able to repair the DNA damage caused by different factors which may lead to the development of cancer. So far, scientists have identified multiple distinct fingerprints of damage in the DNA, known as a mutational signature, that are left by specific causes of cancer, like ultraviolet light and tobacco use. These unique mutational signatures help us understand how certain cancers have developed and how they could have been prevented. Also, mutational signatures are starting to show their importance in providing a better diagnosis and more effective therapy for a patient.

                        </p>

                        <p class="project">
			In this project, we are going to analyze mutational signatures in cancer patients to identify which specific processes are responsible for the development of cancer. Our main tool in this project is going to be the programming environment R. Besides learning a bit of basic R, we will learn how to obtain publicly available genomic data, analyze mutations and detect specific mutational signatures using machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we will analyze the association of our mutational signatures with distinct clinical outcomes of patients.

			 <h3><strong><a name="p4" id="p4"></a>Giving attitude – can opinions be changed?</strong><br/></h3>

                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2021/Iva_project.png"  height="170" hspace="9" align="right" />Today, we are faced with an overwhelming political and moral polarisation in our society. Opinions are getting radicalised and are being more diverse than ever. Learning about what goes into forming an attitude or an opinion can give great insight into the way people think or learn. This way, we can also understand the media world better and it's part in the forming of the narratives of many social currents and try to shield ourselves from unreliable news and information sources. When we reach an understanding of these mechanisms, we can try to build a more understanding society and even develop a variety of social programmes which can help to prevent stigma, prejudice or any other kind of negativity surrounding unfounded opinions.
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">In this workshop, the participants will be able to learn about psychology as a science, especially social psychology, and its many forms of research methods including experimental, non-experimental and qualitative methods. They will conduct their own experiment, write a scientific paper based on their findings, identify all the threats that can compromise the validity of their results and be introduced to basic statistical knowledge used in social sciences research. Learning about the way attitudes, opinions and prejudice are formed is also included in the workshop. In the end, participants will plan their fictional programme to fight misinformation, fake news and fight injustice. They will also design a brochure on the same topic. </p>

                               Jana is Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Science, Department of Chemistry. As a Ph.D. she researched <strong>moleybdenum coordination complexes</strong> and theirs application for <strong>epoxidation reactions</strong>. After the Ph.D. she continued the reserach of molecular and heterogeneous <strong>catalysts</strong> and their application in different catalytic processes. In her free time, Jana enjoys coffees and travelling. Japan is her prefered destination at the moment.

                              The vastness of the universe fascinated Leonardo as a child, who fell in love with physics and astronomy through learning about black holes. As he grew older, Leonardo’s curiosity grew bigger, and he decided to study Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, where his interests shifted from <strong>cosmic expanses</strong> to <strong>nanoscopic scales</strong>. This is why he is now doing his PhD in <strong>nanomagnetism</strong> at ETH Zurich, combining  experiments in electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations to make better magnetic materials. Leonardo joined the Summer School of Science in 2016 as a project leader and returned as an organizer of the S3++ in 2018 and 2019. Leonardo strongly embraces the diversity and tolerance of international environments and looks forward to the Summer School of Science where everyone is free to be who they are.
