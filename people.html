                                        Long time ago, as a child, Nikolina was amazed by the dinosaurs and would carefully follow each and every documentary about them that was shown on TV. She was amused by the thought that one day she’ll become a palaeontologist and search for new dinosaur species in Chile. It turned out quite differently though. She first became (and remained) fond of mathematics, and in the end realized that her true love is chemistry. This happened sometime during the additional chemistry classes in V. gymnasium that she attended. Everything else naturally followed: she decided to study chemistry at Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, where she obtained her BSc and MSc degrees. She developed a specific fondness for research of protein’s function and dynamics, and is now doing her PhD at KU Leuven, Belgium.

                                        Her Summer School of Science story began in 2013 when she was asked to hold a swapshop at S3++. Although she was previously engaged in science popularization activities such as workshops  within <a href="https://hr-hr.facebook.com/Znanstvenecarolije/"><strong>Magic in Science</strong></a> project and mentoring students in V. gymnasium, S3 experience was something completely new. She fell in love with the Summer School, especially its amazing atmosphere. She believes that for those few weeks the School is absolutely the best and most inspiring place in the world for young science enthusiasts. So she came back to lead a project at S<sup>3</sup> 2015, to organize S<sup>3</sup> in 2017 and 2018, and is now back again in the role of S<sup>3</sup> 2019 organizer.

Although her love for science has started back then, she has become aware of it in the elementary school. Discovering the world of biology and chemistry was a real turning point in her life. She has  started to participate in competitions and school projects where she has met her peers with the same interests.

                                        The vastness of the universe fascinated Leonardo as a child, who fell in love with physics and astronomy through learning about black holes and the formation of stars and galaxies. As he grew older, Leonardo’s curiosity grew bigger, and he decided to study Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, where he had the opportunity to learn about all areas of science, whilst maintaining his focus on physics. His interests shifted, however, from unimaginably large cosmic expanses to unimaginably small nanoscopic sizes. This is why he is now pursuing his PhD in nanomagnetism at ETH Zurich, combining experiments and theory in order to investigate exciting new magnetic phenomena and make better magnets for energy conversion, cars and data storage.

                                        Leonardo joined the Summer School of Science in 2016 as a leader of the project “The mystery of light – investigating how a photon can be at two different spots simultaneously”. He thoroughly enjoyed the experience, especially because he was able to share his enthusiasm and passion for science with young students who absorbed new information like a sponge. The most rewarding moments of the School for him were seeing his students’ eyes light up as they discovered something new – Leonardo believes moments like these inspire young people to become scientists. Seeing what an amazing experience the School is for them, he was honored to be an organizer of the S<sup>3</sup>++ 2018 and is even more honored to return in the same role this year.

                                        Apart from science, Leonardo enjoys swimming, cycling and hiking. He is a real nature and animal lover and will be very glad to see pictures of your pets! Leonardo strongly embraces the diversity and tolerance of multinational environments and looks forward to the Summer School of Science and its strong international character.  </p>

                                        Dunja loved solving crosswords and puzzles during childhood. Later her passion shifted to solving mathematical problems and equations and was sure that her future will revolve around mathematics and computational biology. During her last year in primary school she won the second place on state competition in maths and as prize, won a chance to take part in Summer School of Science. There she took a part in a project whose aim was to transform bacteria with fluorescent proteins. Participating in this school opened her doors into a new world of biological sciences which changed her life dramatically. After, she participated in three more summer schools, every time meeting peers with similar interests and working on projects from various scientific fields. In the end she decided that computational biology is the filed that interests her the most. She finished BSc and MSc in Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb and now is perusing a PhD in regulatory genomics at Imperial College London, working on a project that is looking at combinatorial regulation of gene expression during the embryonic development.

She took various roles in organization of open days of her former faculty (“Noc Biologije”) as well as volunteering on Science Festival organized by Imperial College. In 2015 she came back to S3 as project leader, and this year as S<sup>3</sup>++ organizer. In her free time, she enjoys cooking and experimenting with exotic ingredients as well as travelling and spending time in nature.

                                        Anna-Maria has always been fascinated and intrigued by the world around her. Her parents always encouraged her to be curious and to question things around her. At one point, however, things started to get out of hands when she began to ask innocent childish questions to which even adults did not know answers. Over the years, Anna-Maria has grown up, but she still asks a lot of questions. Sometimes, she even confuses Google!

                                        Anna-Maria is a relatively new member of the Summer School family as she joined in 2017. She was one of the project leaders working on the project “Ear in the wall”. Impressed and motivated by the whole event she has returned this year as one of the Co-organizers hoping she can transfer a part of her experience to participants hungry for knowledge and new challenges. Next to science, Anna-Maria enjoys getting lost in the worlds of adventures in books, cooking and traveling. As a fan of international cuisine, she always welcomes new recipes.

                                        Sebastijan has found his interest in science by reading  Jules Verne's works, especially <i>20 000 miles under the sea</i>. Unable to build his own Nautilus, he became interested in computer science, since he was raised up by two informaticians. After writing his first programs in Logo, he was convinced it was the right choise for him.

He was impressed with the motivating atmosphere and passion of young students and educators, so he decided to come back as an organizer.

After hearing some awesome stories about the Summer School of Science, she was introduced to the School in the same year, by doing a workshop on homemade DNA isolation. Petra was quite astonished by the spirit of the School, people that worked there and the enthusiasm of the high school students. In 2012 she returned to the School with her own project at S3++, and twice as an organizer - S3++ in 2013 and S3 in 2015. In year 2017 she was back once more to meet new enthusiasts and inspire new generations to find their inner scientists.

A long time ago, Matija studied Latin and Greek, he was good at it and liked it to a degree that it was what he wanted to study and do for the rest of his days. Fortunately, Matija also had a very good Greek teacher who told him that she would behead him if he did that because she saw a potential for natural sciences. And she was right. Matija is now a Master of Physics working towards a PhD at ETH Zurich and having worked at CERN previously.

                                        For Jelena it all started even before primary school. While loving to watch TV and cartoons, Jelena’s thorough obsession were documentaries, especially ones by  <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough">David Attenborough</a></strong>. She also enjoyed putting puzzles together, usually making it more challenging by turning the pieces upside down. As she went to school, biology and math grew up on her and she especially got interested in human diseases and parasites. What better way to combine the passion for solving problems and natural phenomena than by learning more about these things? Although she was hesitant towards which program to enroll to, she decided to combine the passion for math and human biology by becoming a student at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, where she obtained her B.Sc and M.Sc in Molecular Biology. She recently finished her PhD at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<strong><a href="http://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a></strong> Heidelberg) in a field of genomics. Although she considers herself to be a molecular biologist, she spends most of her time sitting in front of a computer screen performing computational analyses on large genetic variations found within and between different populations. In her free time Jelena likes to read a lot, watch movies, write her beauty blog and travel.

When she got the opportunity to organize  last and subsequently, this year's Summer School, she jumped in without hesitation, despite knowing that it will present a big challenge. Even though she is a relatively new member of the Summer School family, Jelena was always inspired to take part in teaching and promoting science as much as she could through various outreach activities, such as <a href="http://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/"><strong>Night Of Biology</strong></a> and <a href="http://emblog.embl.de/ells/embl-school-ambassadors/embl-school-ambassador-profiles"><strong>EMBL School Ambassador program</strong></a>.

This everlasting French cartoon, telling the story about human body and all those invisible amazing processes that are going on in there, made her want to learn more about the minute world of molecules and chemicals that surround us. During high school, thanks to her biology and chemistry teachers, her love for science was sparked even more, so she decided to study at Faculty of Sciences. She finished her BSc in Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb, after which she moved to Germany to do her MSc at the University of Heidelberg. Currently, she is a PhD student in genomics at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<strong><a href="http://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a></strong>) in Heidelberg, trying to find out what is the importance of the maysterious non-coding genome in the embryonic development.

                                        Is there a better place to fall in love with science than the Summer School of Science? For Antonija, the Summer School is a place is where it all started – she came as a high school student in 2009 and stayed ever since.
                                    </p>
            
                                    <p class="main2">
                                        Antonija did her bachelor studies in chemistry at the University of Zagreb. There she took an advanced course in computational biophysics and, thanks to her brilliant professor Bojan Zagrovic, lost her head over the exciting scientific puzzle – the wobbly 3D structures of biomacromulecules. Merging two passions, science and travelling, lead her to two different parts of world. In Switzerland she investigated the dynamics of amyloid peptide involved in Alzheimer’s disease, while the main topic during her stay in Singapore was protein-protein interactions in the cell. Coming back to Switzerland for her Master studies in Structural Biology and Biophysics at ETH Zurich, she worked on elucidating how proteins adopt their 3D structure while coming out of the ribosome. Antonija is currently examining different opportunities for her graduate studies.

                                        Antonija believes education is one of the most powerful ways to change the world. In Zagreb she led the project “Magic in Science”, with the aim to popularize science through scientific workshops  with kindergarten age children. Last year, together with Andjela Saric, she started the <a href="http://drustvo-evo.hr/internship_portal/index.html"><strong>EVO Internship Portal</strong></a> - an online platform aimed at helping university students to find internships across Europe. After leading two projects at the Summer School of Science in 2011 and 2012, in 2014 she accepted the invitation to organize the School. She hopes to will give back at least a small part of the constant support and enthusiasm that has been given to her ever since she came to the School. Antonija sees the Summer School of Science as her scientific home and is looking forward to lighting a spark for science and critical thinking in general in the new generation of high school students.</p>

                                        Ever since she saw her first documentary on television, Jelena was fascinated by the interaction between the climate, environment and mutations, which result in creating unique beings in extraordinary settings. This fascination lead her to science, and later to geology. She has successfully graduated in the Department of Geology and Palaeontology, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, and later on applied for the postgraduate program in the same Department.

                                        During her studies, Jelena encountered many areas of geology, but always had a special interest in Sequence geology and Palaeontology. In general, evolution is the area she is the most interested in, ever since on her second year of college she attended the course in Historical geology, which thrilled her. That was exactly what attracted Jelena to geology or more precisely to palaeontology – evolution of the universe, Earth and the life on Earth, as well as finding out how and why the changes occurred and the realization that nothing is permanent. To evolve means to change and that is a process which, once started, cannot be reversed, and she enjoys very much in deciphering and solving clues left by evolution to puzzle out how ancient worlds on Earth looked like. Jelena would like to be one of the people who could contribute to solving and explaining of the processes around us and inside of us. Each of us has a natural urge to know one self and the world around them. In order to make that possible, it is essential to know were we came from and which processes and changes have created us the way we are.

                                        As knowledge, and subsequently science, grows and evolves through interaction and community, upon hearing about Summer School of Science, Jelena immediately liked the idea of enriching young minds and became a part of it. She first came as a Swapshop and project leader, and in 2014 as an organisator. Jelena is a passionate book reader and reading consumes a lot of her spare time. A wide array of topics interest her - popular science, historical novels, psychology, detective and spy novels, science fiction and fantasy novels. Also, Jelena is a firm believer in exercising one’s mind, so enjoys practicing logic and problem solving games like sudoku, chess and card games.

A little car which went forwards and backwards might have not been a big step in technology, but for Nemanja it was a great motivation. Already in his 7th grade of elementary school he became a part of the <a href="http://petnica.rs/?option=com_content&view=article&id=27&Itemid=41"><strong>Petnica Science Center</strong></a>. During his high school years he continued his work in Petnica through seminars in Applied Physics and Electronics. Throughout the four years there he worked on several projects. In his 3rd grade, he published a paper entitled “Optical tracing of fingers and recognition of characteristic movements”. Any student’s stay in Petnica is not only focused on scientific work, friendships made there are lifelong which is one of many reasons why Nemanja advocates for the popularization of science. Therefore he participated at the Festival of Science in Belgrade where, together with his colleagues, he held workshops for children.

There he worked on a computer science project with three students from different parts of the world. Amazed by the work on the School in 2012 he came back as a swapshop leader, and in 2013 he returned to lead a project. To continue to share the enthusiasm which was given to him by his project leaders and organisers in previous years, in 2014 he accepted the invitation to organize the School in Pozega.

                                        As a child, Neva was more interested in languages and law then science. However, everything changed during high school as the biology lectures turned to genetics. Mostly thanks to her biology teacher who encouraged her, she got more and more interested and fascinated by the miracle that is life and genetics that stood behind that. Even though she initially wanted to study molecular biology, Neva ended up being accepted to the Physics Department at the University of Zagreb. During her first year of study, she completely fell in love with physics as a science thanks to great professors and teaching assistants who finally showed her that physics isn’t complicated and boring but fun and exciting.

The project was about bringing magnetism closer to high school students as, even though it's exceptionally interesting, due to complexity magnetism is not so much represented in everyday school physics. Projects resulted with a demonstrational kit for 27 experiments, instructions on how to perform them and a video for each experiment.

The energy of the School got under her skin almost instantly as she met all these wonderful people who shared the same passion to bring science closer to kids and high school students. That’s why Neva came back the following year to co-lead a project on physics of strongly correlated electronic materials. In 2013, she decided to join the Society for Out-of-Frame Education and help to organize and develop the Summer School of Science even further.

Finishing high school, Petra had troubles to decide what to study as she was able to find something exciting and interesting in almost everything. Molecular biology, maths, psychology and electrical engineering were at the top of her list, but on the day of the decision, when she entered the old building of Biology Department and her name was read, she knew she is at the right place. Studying biology was one of most motivating and interesting periods of Petra's life to date. Petra was a part of a small group of ambitious enthusiasts that were always eager to learn and experience more.

After doing her bachelor's and master's thesis, as well as several internships in molecular plant microbiology, Petra was employed as a Research Fellow and Teaching Assistant at Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Medical Faculty in Rijeka. There she investigated interactions of human pathogens, like Legionella spp. with immune system cells, amoeba and other bacteria. Currently she is doing her PhD at Max F. Perutz Laboratories in Vienna, where she is studying molecular mechanisms of regulation of catabolite repression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, human pathogen that causes serious problems in patients with cystic fibrosis.

During her studies in Zagreb, she met Branko Durdevic who introduced her to the Summer School of Science in 2007. Once she experienced the atmosphere there, popularization of science among youngsters become something that is a great source of inspiration and energy that drives her forward from then on. Petra sees the Summer School of Science as an international melting pot of creativity, enthusiasm and brilliant ideas with a flavour of real love and passion for science. Students at the School represent a pluripotent mass of ideas that absorb like a sponge whatever is happening around them. Mentors, trying to give them a different (scientific) insight on the matters of life and to nurture their love for science, in the end become the ones who are taught.

                                        From a very early age, Marko was interested in mathematics. But soon, after “discovering” chemistry, his focus changed from numbers to molecules. That was mostly due to his chemistry teachers who encouraged him to learn more. He took part in chemistry competitions, and in 2003, while still in high school in Zagreb, won a bronze medal on the 35th International Chemistry Olympiad in Greece. Chemistry was a logical choice for his career. He graduated chemistry at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb and started a PhD in biochemistry. At the moment, Marko is working at the Ruder Boskovic Institute in Zagreb. His scientific interests are molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease, especially the role of lipids in neurodegeneration. Since 15 million people suffer from Alzheimer’s disease worldwide and the real cause is still unknown, Marko finds this topic is extremely challenging and scientifically attractive.

                                        In addition to chemistry, Marko’s passion is science communication and popularization. He is actively involved in Zagreb Science Festival (Science Fair) since 2007 as a lecturer and workshop leader. He participated as an invited speaker in other Science Festivals (Novi Sad, Athens, Sinj) as well. In 2008, Marko won Croatian and International FameLab competition (Cheltenham, UK), a competition in 3 minute oral presentations on scientific topics without any slides. His winning presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX5KpqHo4iA"><strong>  “Biochemistry of love”</strong></a> attracted media and resulted with more than 40 interviews for national and foreign TVs, newspapers and radio stations. In 2012 he was invited speaker on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3III_EW7zg"><strong>TEDxMaksimir</strong></a> where he spoke about his activities in science communication.

                                       Marko is also active in education. Since 2005, he prepares young Croatian representatives for International Chemistry Olympiad. He first came to the Summer School of Science in 2007, on suggestion of his friend, Tomislav Kokotovic (former participant and later, mentor). Marko really enjoyed working with talented and motivated high school students. He was fascinated with how much science one can do in an improvised lab without sophisticated equipment, if one has enough enthusiasm. He came back to the School as a mentor in 2008, and as an organizer in the following years (2009 - 2011). Since 2012 he is the member of Summer School of Science Organizing Committee.

                                        As a child of two mathematicians, Ivan’s fascination with natural sciences was sparked off at a very early age. At first he thought chemistry would be his vocation, but during high school he started to explore the world of physics by preparing for the IYPT (International Young Physicists' Tournament).  During high school he spent most of his free time with his teammates working on experimental setups and solutions to scientific problems, which culminated in winning the first place in 2006. Physics fascinated him because it is a tool for improving the world, since physics holds the key to innovating technologies and advancing humanity. He decided to pursue his career as a physicist and is currently finishing his graduate studies at the Department of Physics at the Faculty of Science in Zagreb. His main field of interest is solid state physics. His efforts in that area earned him the Rector’s Award. Lately, he has a growing interest into application of physics in environmental sciences.

Ever since he could remember there was a computer lying around, so computer science sparked his interest the most. All this led to graduating computer science at the University of Zagreb and doing various programming projects dealing with a wide array of topics - from artificial intelligence, face and speech recognition to multimedia entertainment applications and distributed computing solutions. Drazen is currently working on his PhD on the topic of energy efficient cloud computing, employed as a research assistant at the Vienna University of Technology.

                                        Anamarija fell in love with science at a very early age. When she was 7, she started helping her father, also a scientist, with his plant biology experiments. After undergraduate studies in biotechnology at the University of Zagreb, she continued with the doctoral program there and finally received a Ph.D. in molecular genetics. During her graduate training, she investigated molecular mechanisms underlying gene replacement in the simplest eukaryotic model organism, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Anamarija moved to France where she, as a postdoctoral researcher, studied mechanisms involved in yeast aging at INSERM U1001, Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaires, Faculte de Medicine Paris Descartes. Recently she returned to DNA repair field and at the moment she is a postdoctoral researcher studying mechanisms of homologous recombination in yeast at Columbia University in New York, USA.

As difficult as it was to choose, in the end he decided to study physics. He saw physics as the most fundamental of all the sciences and a discipline that offers a deep understanding of nature. That also made it the most mysterious. He is currently finishing his undergraduate studies at the University of Zagreb and is thinking of pursuing a scientific career in cosmology or particle physics.

What he loved the most was the fact that he finally found a place where he could meet people of similar interests and where he could ask all the questions he always wanted to ask. He has been coming back ever since, either as a technical assistant, project leader or school organizer. The School also went along with his interest in education, especially because he feels that regular schools usually don’t promote critical thinking and creativity so he wants to help change that.

                                        Tomislav fell in love with chemistry under the influence of his high school chemistry teacher. Doing experiments with beautiful colours and all the other "wonders" performed in test tubes at the time teased his imagination and awoke the thirst to understand puzzles behind those experiments. This motivated him to learn more and take part in several national competitions and at the International Chemistry Olympiad where he won bronze medal. Later, interest in chemistry broadens to molecular and human biology. Interest in both people and scientific way of comprehending the world melted together for several years and resulted with a wish to become a medical doctor.

Wanting to deepen insight in molecular background of different malfunctions of the organism, Tomislav joined research labs dealing with tumour biochemistry and genetics. He also won a Rektor's prize for results on investigation of the Wnt signaling pathway's role in neuroepithelial brain tumour development. The plan for the future is to connect passion in science and medicine by doing bench-to-bedside translational research.

                                       Tomislav was a participant at Summer School of Science in 2004. S3 was to him a unique opportunity to have hands on experience in science and to be thought scientific method by experts of their fields. Great perspective acquired in Višnjan and stimulating high school education shaped his way of thinking about science as a field which combines knowledge and problem solving with creativity. Since learning science gave him the feeling of liberty, Tomislav wanted to transfer this idea further which motivated him to take part in different projects in science communication. In following years he came back to Višnjan to do workshops, then a project and finally to organize S3. He also took an active part in other popular science projects like Science Festival at School of Medicine and a workshop in Science Communication (collaboration of School of Medicine University of Zagreb and Ecole Normale Superiur Paris). Currently he moved to different aspect of science communication and now he is editing scientific section in medical students' journal Medicinar. A goal of this section is accenting importance of bridging basic science and medicine.

                                        Ever since his early childhood, Fran was drawn to the natural world. His curiosity was ignited by walks through nature his grandfather took him to, while telling him stories about the medicinal properties of plants, how songs of different birds sounded, or why moss grew on north side of trees.  This interest was rivaled only by the arrival of his first computer, a Commodore 64, and a book that described how to make it do mostly useless but fun things using the BASIC programming language.  With his focus shifting between biology and computers, Fran finally decided to study molecular biology. He graduated at the University of Zagreb with a diploma in bioinformatics, a young and exciting discipline at the time.

                                        Andela's affair with natural sciences began under the influence of her father, a medical doctor. As a child she was amazed with biology and the human body. Growing up, her interests moved to more fundamental sciences: chemistry and physics. To her, the idea that by performing a chemical reaction in a flask you actually recombine atoms and create completely new organizations was utterly appealing. Chemistry gave her the feeling of unlimited creativity, while physics added the rationality and control. Today, Andela is becoming an expert in chemical physics.

                                    During her stimulating high school education, Andela took part in different national scientific competitions and in the International Chemistry Olympiads, winning a bronze medal. She started her research career in theoretical chemistry still while majoring chemistry at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb. This encouraged her to move to New York to do her Ph.D. at Columbia University. Currently, she is working on understanding physics of various soft material systems, including artificial/biological membranes and synthetic/biopolymers.

                                    Andela first came to Summer School of Science in 2005, as a workshop leader. Like most of the people who visit the school, she fell in love with the atmosphere, informal way of gaining knowledge and the lovely people. She keeps coming back, and has participated in the School as a project leader, lecturer or organizer ever since. Andela sees the School as a great polygon for assisting young minds to find their way and is interested in taking part in the School's development. Her goal is to enable participation to every interested student, regardless of the educational or economical background.

                                        Korado Korlevic is a native of Visnjan. Since a very young age, he was fascinated by astronomy (as a boy he copied a whole astronomy book  - “Nase nebo” from Oton Kucera - by hand). After studying physics education in Rijeka, he worked in the primary school in Visnjan for 12 years. He was very active in leading extracurricular  activities for his students, who went on to win the highest prizes on national science competitions. Korado is one of the founders of Visnjan Observatory and its first larger educational project, Visnjan School of Astronomy, initiated in 1986.

                                    His scientific interests led him first to an expedition in Tunguska (Russia), where he explored the asteroid impact craters. Motivated by the possibility of asteroid collisions with the Earth, he started asteroid monitoring at the <a href="http://astro.hr"><strong>Visnjan Observatory</strong></a> - work that resulted in the discovery of more than 1400 asteroids and two comets that bear his name. Visnjan Observatory is placed among world’s twelve most productive Observatories of all times.

                                       Korado continues to be active in science education and asteroid astronomy. Among his current projects are the creation of new the observatory in a near-by village Tican and the establishment of the new Science and Education Center Visnjan that cooperates internationally through the Network of Youth Excellence. In 2005, he initiated a new national science competition, VIP EUREKA, based on experimental research performed by high-school students. He provided crucial organizing support (fundraising and on-site coordination) for the Summer School of Science since it’s beginning, in 2001. He is still active as a mentor at the Visnjan School of Astronomy.

                                        Martina was introduced to molecular biology by one of her teachers, while still in high school in Bjelovar (Croatia). That was the time of important breakthroughs in the field, like sheep Dolly cloning and finding the cause of the "mad cow" disease. Even though she always had a strong interest in art (she has 11 years of education in music), she was so curious about what is going on in laboratories that she decided to study molecular biology.

He therefore decided to study physics at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, where something unexpected happened – one of his first-year professors showed him the beauty of mathematics. Even though Grgur had always been good at mathematics, he only saw it as a tool up to that point. From then on, however, he started to view it as a sort of a language with its own set of rules (you could call it grammar if you want) and purity no other scientific discipline exhibits. As a result, he obtained M.Sc. degree in physics with a special interest in mathematical physics.

                                        Popularization of science entered Grgur’s life in 2015 when he became a workshop leader at the Summer School of Physics, where he returned in 2016 in the same role. Now he will join the Summer School of Science in Požega as a technical assistant in order to gain new experiences and help participants see the real beauty of science (and math).

                                        Monika gave more serious thought on going into science after participating in Summer School of Science in Požega in 2013. Before that she had many interests, the biggest being music. She went to Music School and planned on going to Music Academy. Few months before the end of high school she had a change of heart and chose to study Mathematics at Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Zagreb. What she loves the most about Math is the purity that comes with proofs and beauty that emerges from a human mind when an idea for solving a particular problem occurs.

                                        My story with science has started a long time ago when I was still a child, I just haven’t known that then. As I learned to count I started to look for patterns around me, in licence plates, tiles, really everywhere you can look I could find a mystery of numbers and shapes, and I still enjoy a good mystery series or novel. As I grow up I found out that science is a grate tool for solving mysteries and put your curiosity in a good use, and that is how I decided to become an engineer. So, I am now a student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb, and studying to become an electrical engineer.

So two years later, as I just finished my first year in college, I came back as a Swapshop leader. It was a great experience, everyone was so friendly, enthusiastic and creative and the atmosphere was even better then I remembered. From there my motivation for teaching and promoting science just grew, I became more active in college where I am a demonstrator in several classes and I volunteered at Night of Science. When I was offered a place as a technical assistant at this year’s Summer school I jumped right in, and was ready for a new challenge and lots of new great people to share this experience with.

Later, he became more interested in evolutionary biology and medicine thanks to his high school teacher who encouraged him to do his own research. It all resulted in different individual and joint (Croatian Institute for Public Health, Croatian Academy of Science and Arts Pozega...) interdisciplinary projects. He has published a paleodemographical roundup of an archeological site near Pozega and is planing to pursue similar ideas. Apart from the natural sciences, Tonko likes to experiment with social sciences such as sociology. He finds interdisciplinarity as an only way to improve one's knowledge and outside-the-box thinking.
