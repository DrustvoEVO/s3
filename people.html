                                        For Dora, it all started at the Summer School of Science 2014. Having diverse interests and motivation to pursue them all, she decided to join the Summer School of Science in her third year of high school. While working on a molecular biology project and listening to talks of visiting scientists, she fell in love with science and has stayed ever since.

                                    <p class="main2">
                                        After attending the School, her passion for understanding molecular processes in living organisms only grew. This is why she decided to study at the Faculty of Science (Zagreb), where she obtained her B.Sc and M.Sc in Molecular Biology. Excitingly, throughout her studies, she was a lab-partner with her roommate at the Summer School of Science back in 2014. Looking for new experiences during her studies, she joined the lab for Chromatin and Ageing at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing for a summer internship, and for her master’s thesis. There, she fell in love with the regulation of the initial stages of gene transcription, which she will also be studying during her PhD.

                                        Dora’s story with Summer School of Science did not end in 2014. Wanting to bring back the energy and motivation she gained there as a high school student, she returned in 2016 and 2017 as a swapshop leader and technical assistant. After organizing S3 2018 and S3 2019, she is now back as S3 2022 organizer. For her, the possibility of inspiring the students to learn about, and engage in, science is uplifting. In her free time, Dora enjoys watching series and movies, reading books (often in languages she doesn’t really speak), or simply walking in nature.

                                        Luka has always been a curious and imaginative individual with a great desire to understand everything he encounters. At first, this mainly manifested through his passion for physics and mathematics, but as soon as he discovered computer science and programming, it became his number one preoccupation. He also shaped his education and career around it, enjoying not only learning about it but also teaching others everything he knows. His other interests include photography, architecture and traffic management, which often perfectly fit as applications for his computer science and programming knowledge.

                                        Laura has always liked asking questions, whether it be about the mundane or the incomprehensible, and maintains that childlike curiosity to this day. She has accumulated a number of different interests, ranging from music to film to nonograms and, of course, science. Her love of science started as a fascination with all things cosmic, mostly due to her outright obsession with Carl Sagan. This passion grew and eventually branched out into other fields. Ultimately, however, her wish to study the universe itself prevailed, which is why she is currently pursuing a degree in physics at the Faculty of Science in Zagreb.

She also spends her free time drawing, learning new things of various sorts (like piano, languages or info from the rarest of Wikipedia pages), reading more books at a time than she probably should, as well as walking, cycling or ice skating... basically, quite a few things, many of which she has a terrible habit of doing late into the night.

                                        The vastness of the universe fascinated Leonardo as a child, who fell in love with astrophysics through learning about black holes and distant galaxies. As he grew older, Leonardo's curiosity grew bigger, and he decided to study Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, where he had the opportunity to learn about all areas of science, whilst maintaining his focus on physics. His interests shifted, however, from large cosmic expanses to small nanoscopic sizes. That is why he finished his PhD in nanomagnetism at ETH Zurich, combining experiments and theory in order to investigate exciting magnetic phenomena and make better magnets for energy conversion, electric cars and supercomputers. Today, Leonardo is a full time educational tutor and a director of an education company "Persona Academica".

                                        Leonardo joined the Summer School of Science in 2016 as a leader of the project 'The mystery of light - investigating how a photon can be at two different spots simultaneously'. The most rewarding moments of the School for him were seeing his students' eyes light up as they discovered something new. Leonardo believes moments like these inspire young people to become scientists. Leonardo was honored to be an organizer of the S3++ 2018 in 2019 and is even more honored to return in the same role this year.

Leonardo strongly embraces diversity and tolerance and does his best to make the Summer School of Science a safer place for everyone, regardless of their race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion or ethnicity.

                                        Ever since she was a child, Liza was fascinated by learning. The curiosity led her into starting her own school newspapers, dancing, acting, playing tennis, learning informatics and modelling. She was fascinated by all that is possible to do in the world and that's why she chose engineering to express herself. Her love for physics and technology drove her to study Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Croatia, and there she discovered her true passion - electronics. The way physics manifests its power in small electronics devices fascinated her, so she chose to specialize her masters in Electronics Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano in Italy. There she learned from the inventors of single-photon avalanche diodes and modern transistors. After attending Signal Recovery course, a spark in her appeared. She was intrigued by the way light interacts with electronics and how humans can build extremely sensitive photodetectors to record the invisible environment. That's why she chose to study characteristics of single-photon avalanche diodes for her master thesis "Temporal response modelling and extraction of deep level defects in single-photon avalanche diodes". The work continued as a project at EPFL in Switzerland, where she worked on characterization of single-photon devices at cryogenic temperatures. The more she learned, the more she realised how unique the physics at cryogenic temperatures is and how vast is the field, still quite unknown to the human knowledge. The potential of the unexplored and her wish to study physics on a deeper level led her to learn about materials and their impact on the devices at ETH Zürich, where she studied Solid State Physics and Semiconductor Nanostructures. She also worked on neural recording, in particular, the design of integrated readout circuits for single-photon diodes arrays, and simulations of electrodes for optical traps. Currently she is a PhD student in nanophysics at the University of Basel in Switzerland where her main interest is designing reliable and strong nanomagnets for spin qubit control. Apart from her studies and teaching, she is working as a quantum hardware engineer at nanotechnology startup Qnami.

Luckily enough, she didn't catch any disease from it! A few years later, her primary school teacher recognized her passion and encouraged her to use her curiosity to grow as a biologist. That led her to graduate in Biochemistry at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom. During her studies, she focused on personalised medicine in breast and brain cancer and became fascinated with bioinformatics. Realising the importance of data science and machine learning in biology, she decided to pursue her career as a bioinformatician. Currently, she is doing her internship at Illumina, working on DRAGEN development; one of the strongest existing software for genome analysis.

                                        Vedrana has always shown an interest in experimenting with the things that surround her. When she was younger, this mostly meant she made a mess in the kitchen with her failed baking experiments. She always wanted to know why things are the way they are, how things work and viewed the whole world as simply unexplainable and all a big mystery. As she grew, so did her interest in all things natural and unnatural; although her first real love was robotics and mathematics, she later realized that she needs to understand the very basics of life and therefore choose to turn to chemistry. Chemistry also seemed the obvious choice to anyone who had ever seen how much she enjoys changing recipes to figure out what component is responsible for what effect.

                                        Vedrana first got to experience the Summer School of Science as a participant in the S3 camps in 2018 and 2019. Though she had had her doubts about the camp before arriving, it was obvious from the moment she arrived that these were the people she would enjoy working with. The long hours, multiple failed prototypes and terrible jokes were all crucial elements in igniting her interest to apply again and, eventually, become a part of the organization itself. She became a technical assistant in 2022 and hopes to spend the rest of her life somehow contributing to the organization.

                                        Vedrana is currently in her first year of studying Applied Chemistry at the Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology in Zagreb. While she could truly devote her whole life solely to learning, she does enjoy spending her free time baking, writing and making extremely detailed plans for an education revolution. Naturally, she does all of this with headphones in her ears because she prefers working with background noise; be it a TED talk, new playlist or realityTV show.

                                                Mario has always been interested in everything in his surroundings. Deciding what to do in life has been one of his biggest problems. Since elementary school, he has been interested in chemistry, physics and biology. Newer additions to his interests are mathematics and programming. Seeing how everything is connected, Mario looked hard for a place where he could combine all his interests. In the end, he decided to study medicine because of the broadness of the field, and many, many possibilities and chances later in life. He never regretted the decision because he found the field in which he could truly use everything he was interested in - neuroscience.

From the first day, he loved the concept of the School and wished to get involved and contribute as much as he could. He got an opportunity to be in a role of a technical assistant in 2018 and 2019 and an organizer in 2020 so he is now returning as an organizer.

                                                Mario Borna had always been amazed by the wonders of the world, human accomplishments and technology and its promises. His passion for computer science was born when he first touched a computer as a child, and it followed him ever since. When he solved his first equation in primary school, another passion was sparked: the passion for mathematics. He daydreamed of being a mathematician.

                                                Ever since he was a child, Grgur had been amazed by the world around him. He wondered how things happen and why they happen the way they do. Because of that, he fell in love with science from the first moment he got into contact with it, primarily physics. So he went to study physics at Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb where something unexpected happened. One of his first-year professors showed him the beauty of mathematics. Even though Grgur was always good at mathematics, he saw it just as a tool up to that point. However, from then on, he viewed it as a sort of language with its own set of rules (you could call it grammar if you want) and purity no other scientific discipline exhibits. As a result, he obtained MSc degree in physics with the special interest in mathematical physics.

He joined Summer School of Science in Požega two years ago first as a technical assistant and last year as a project leader on S3++ camp. He is looking forward to coming back to the school, this time as an organiser.

He is studying generalized complex geometry (or at least some part of it) and its application to physics, e.g. string theory. In addition to this, he is also a teaching assistant for several courses at the Physics Department of University of Zagreb.

                                        Long time ago, as a child, Nikolina was amazed by the dinosaurs and would carefully follow each and every documentary about them that was shown on TV. She was amused by the thought that one day she'll become a palaeontologist and search for new dinosaur species in Chile. It turned out quite differently though. She first became (and remained) fond of mathematics, and in the end realized that her true love is chemistry. This happened sometime during the additional chemistry classes in V. gymnasium that she attended. Everything else naturally followed: she decided to study chemistry at Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, where she obtained her BSc and MSc degrees. She developed a specific fondness for research of protein's function and dynamics, and is now doing her PhD at KU Leuven, Belgium.

Although she was previously engaged in science popularization activities such as workshops within <a href="https://hr-hr.facebook.com/Znanstvenecarolije/"><strong>Magic in Science</strong></a> project and mentoring students in V. gymnasium, S3 experience was something completely new. She fell in love with the Summer School, especially its amazing atmosphere. She believes that for those few weeks the School is absolutely the best and most inspiring place in the world for young science enthusiasts. So she came back to lead a project at S<sup>3</sup> 2015, to organize S<sup>3</sup> in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and is now back again in the role of S<sup>3</sup> 2020 organizer.

                                        Dunja loved solving crosswords and puzzles during childhood. Later her passion shifted to solving mathematical problems and equations and was sure that her future will revolve around mathematics and computational biology. During her last year in primary school she won the second place on state competition in maths and as prize, won a chance to take part in Summer School of Science. There she took a part in a project whose aim was to transform bacteria with fluorescent proteins. Participating in this school opened her doors into a new world of biological sciences which changed her life dramatically. After, she participated in three more summer schools, every time meeting peers with similar interests and working on projects from various scientific fields. In the end she decided that computational biology is the filed that interests her the most. She finished BSc and MSc in Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb and now is perusing a PhD in regulatory genomics at Imperial College London, working on a project that is looking at combinatorial regulation of gene expression during the embryonic development.

She took various roles in organization of open days of her former faculty ('Noc Biologije') as well as volunteering on Science Festival organized by Imperial College. In 2015 she came back to S3 as project leader, and this year as S<sup>3</sup>++ organizer. In her free time, she enjoys cooking and experimenting with exotic ingredients as well as travelling and spending time in nature.

Petra was quite astonished by the spirit of the School, people that worked there and the enthusiasm of the high school students. In 2012 she returned to the School with her own project at S3++, and twice as an organizer - S3++ in 2013 and S3 in 2015. In year 2017 she was back once more to meet new enthusiasts and inspire new generations to find their inner scientists.

A long time ago, Matija studied Latin and Greek, he was good at it and liked it to a degree that it was what he wanted to study and do for the rest of his days. Fortunately, Matija also had a very good Greek teacher who told him that she would behead him if he did that because she saw a potential for natural sciences. And she was right. Matija is now a Master of Physics working towards a PhD at ETH Zurich and having worked at CERN previously. His field of research is manipulation of the motion of highly-excited atoms using electric and magnetic fields.

                                        For Jelena it all started even before primary school. While loving to watch TV and cartoons, Jelena's thorough obsession were documentaries, especially ones by  <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough">David Attenborough</a></strong>. She also enjoyed putting puzzles together, usually making it more challenging by turning the pieces upside down. As she went to school, biology and math grew up on her and she especially got interested in human diseases and parasites. What better way to combine the passion for solving problems and natural phenomena than by learning more about these things? Although she was hesitant towards which program to enroll to, she decided to combine the passion for math and human biology by becoming a student at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, where she obtained her B.Sc and M.Sc in Molecular Biology. She recently finished her PhD at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<strong><a href="http://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a></strong> Heidelberg) in a field of genomics. Although she considers herself to be a molecular biologist, she spends most of her time sitting in front of a computer screen performing computational analyses on large genetic variations found within and between different populations. In her free time Jelena likes to read a lot, watch movies, write her beauty blog and travel.

When she got the opportunity to organize  last and subsequently, this year's Summer School, she jumped in without hesitation, despite knowing that it will present a big challenge. Even though she is a relatively new member of the Summer School family, Jelena was always inspired to take part in teaching and promoting science as much as she could through various outreach activities, such as <a href="http://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/"><strong>Night Of Biology</strong></a> and <a href="http://emblog.embl.de/ells/embl-school-ambassadors/embl-school-ambassador-profiles"><strong>EMBL School Ambassador program</strong></a>.

                                        Unlike today, as a kid Matilda watched a lot of TV. Fortunately for her, TV had something to offer back then, and one her favourite shows was <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284735/">'Il etais une fois la vie'</a></strong>. This everlasting French cartoon, telling the story about human body and all those invisible amazing processes that are going on in there, made her want to learn more about the minute world of molecules and chemicals that surround us. During high school, thanks to her biology and chemistry teachers, her love for science was sparked even more, so she decided to study at Faculty of Sciences. She finished her BSc in Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb, after which she moved to Germany to do her MSc at the University of Heidelberg. Currently, she is a PhD student in genomics at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<strong><a href="http://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a></strong>) in Heidelberg, trying to find out what is the importance of the maysterious non-coding genome in the embryonic development.

                                        Antonija believes education is one of the most powerful ways to change the world. In Zagreb she led the project 'Magic in Science', with the aim to popularize science through scientific workshops  with kindergarten age children. Last year, together with Andjela Saric, she started the <a href="http://drustvo-evo.hr/internship_portal/index.html"><strong>EVO Internship Portal</strong></a> - an online platform aimed at helping university students to find internships across Europe. After leading two projects at the Summer School of Science in 2011 and 2012, in 2014 she accepted the invitation to organize the School. She hopes to will give back at least a small part of the constant support and enthusiasm that has been given to her ever since she came to the School. Antonija sees the Summer School of Science as her scientific home and is looking forward to lighting a spark for science and critical thinking in general in the new generation of high school students.</p>

                                        Ever since she saw her first documentary on television, Jelena was fascinated by the interaction between the climate, environment and mutations, which result in creating unique beings in extraordinary settings. This fascination lead her to science, and later to geology. She has successfully graduated in the Department of Geology and Palaeontology, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, and later on applied for the postgraduate program in the same Department.

                                        During her studies, Jelena encountered many areas of geology, but always had a special interest in Sequence geology and Palaeontology. In general, evolution is the area she is the most interested in, ever since on her second year of college she attended the course in Historical geology, which thrilled her. That was exactly what attracted Jelena to geology or more precisely to palaeontology - evolution of the universe, Earth and the life on Earth, as well as finding out how and why the changes occurred and the realization that nothing is permanent. To evolve means to change and that is a process which, once started, cannot be reversed, and she enjoys very much in deciphering and solving clues left by evolution to puzzle out how ancient worlds on Earth looked like. Jelena would like to be one of the people who could contribute to solving and explaining of the processes around us and inside of us. Each of us has a natural urge to know one self and the world around them. In order to make that possible, it is essential to know were we came from and which processes and changes have created us the way we are.

                                        As knowledge, and subsequently science, grows and evolves through interaction and community, upon hearing about Summer School of Science, Jelena immediately liked the idea of enriching young minds and became a part of it. She first came as a Swapshop and project leader, and in 2014 as an organisator. Jelena is a passionate book reader and reading consumes a lot of her spare time. A wide array of topics interest her - popular science, historical novels, psychology, detective and spy novels, science fiction and fantasy novels. Also, Jelena is a firm believer in exercising one's mind, so enjoys practicing logic and problem solving games like sudoku, chess and card games.

A little car which went forwards and backwards might have not been a big step in technology, but for Nemanja it was a great motivation. Already in his 7th grade of elementary school he became a part of the <a href="http://petnica.rs/?option=com_content&view=article&id=27&Itemid=41"><strong>Petnica Science Center</strong></a>. During his high school years he continued his work in Petnica through seminars in Applied Physics and Electronics. Throughout the four years there he worked on several projects. In his 3rd grade, he published a paper entitled 'Optical tracing of fingers and recognition of characteristic movements'. Any student's stay in Petnica is not only focused on scientific work, friendships made there are lifelong which is one of many reasons why Nemanja advocates for the popularization of science. Therefore he participated at the Festival of Science in Belgrade where, together with his colleagues, he held workshops for children.

There he worked on a computer science project with three students from different parts of the world. Amazed by the work on the School in 2012 he came back as a swapshop leader, and in 2013 he returned to lead a project. To continue to share the enthusiasm which was given to him by his project leaders and organisers in previous years, in 2014 he accepted the invitation to organize the School in Pozega.

                                        As a child, Neva was more interested in languages and law then science. However, everything changed during high school as the biology lectures turned to genetics. Mostly thanks to her biology teacher who encouraged her, she got more and more interested and fascinated by the miracle that is life and genetics that stood behind that. Even though she initially wanted to study molecular biology, Neva ended up being accepted to the Physics Department at the University of Zagreb. During her first year of study, she completely fell in love with physics as a science thanks to great professors and teaching assistants who finally showed her that physics isn't complicated and boring but fun and exciting.

The project was about bringing magnetism closer to high school students as, even though it's exceptionally interesting, due to complexity magnetism is not so much represented in everyday school physics. Projects resulted with a demonstrational kit for 27 experiments, instructions on how to perform them and a video for each experiment.

The energy of the School got under her skin almost instantly as she met all these wonderful people who shared the same passion to bring science closer to kids and high school students. That's why Neva came back the following year to co-lead a project on physics of strongly correlated electronic materials. In 2013, she decided to join the Society for Out-of-Frame Education and help to organize and develop the Summer School of Science even further.

Finishing high school, Petra had troubles to decide what to study as she was able to find something exciting and interesting in almost everything. Molecular biology, maths, psychology and electrical engineering were at the top of her list, but on the day of the decision, when she entered the old building of Biology Department and her name was read, she knew she is at the right place. Studying biology was one of most motivating and interesting periods of Petra's life to date. Petra was a part of a small group of ambitious enthusiasts that were always eager to learn and experience more.

After doing her bachelor's and master's thesis, as well as several internships in molecular plant microbiology, Petra was employed as a Research Fellow and Teaching Assistant at Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Medical Faculty in Rijeka. There she investigated interactions of human pathogens, like Legionella spp. with immune system cells, amoeba and other bacteria. Currently she is doing her PhD at Max F. Perutz Laboratories in Vienna, where she is studying molecular mechanisms of regulation of catabolite repression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, human pathogen that causes serious problems in patients with cystic fibrosis.

During her studies in Zagreb, she met Branko Durdevic who introduced her to the Summer School of Science in 2007. Once she experienced the atmosphere there, popularization of science among youngsters become something that is a great source of inspiration and energy that drives her forward from then on. Petra sees the Summer School of Science as an international melting pot of creativity, enthusiasm and brilliant ideas with a flavour of real love and passion for science. Students at the School represent a pluripotent mass of ideas that absorb like a sponge whatever is happening around them. Mentors, trying to give them a different (scientific) insight on the matters of life and to nurture their love for science, in the end become the ones who are taught.

                                        From a very early age, Marko was interested in mathematics. But soon, after 'discovering' chemistry, his focus changed from numbers to molecules. That was mostly due to his chemistry teachers who encouraged him to learn more. He took part in chemistry competitions, and in 2003, while still in high school in Zagreb, won a bronze medal on the 35th International Chemistry Olympiad in Greece. Chemistry was a logical choice for his career. He graduated chemistry at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb and started a PhD in biochemistry. At the moment, Marko is working at the Ruder Boskovic Institute in Zagreb. His scientific interests are molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, especially the role of lipids in neurodegeneration. Since 15 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease worldwide and the real cause is still unknown, Marko finds this topic is extremely challenging and scientifically attractive.

He participated as an invited speaker in other Science Festivals (Novi Sad, Athens, Sinj) as well. In 2008, Marko won Croatian and International FameLab competition (Cheltenham, UK), a competition in 3 minute oral presentations on scientific topics without any slides. His winning presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX5KpqHo4iA"><strong>  'Biochemistry of love'</strong></a> attracted media and resulted with more than 40 interviews for national and foreign TVs, newspapers and radio stations. In 2012 he was invited speaker on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3III_EW7zg"><strong>TEDxMaksimir</strong></a> where he spoke about his activities in science communication.

He first came to the Summer School of Science in 2007, on suggestion of his friend, Tomislav Kokotovic (former participant and later, mentor). Marko really enjoyed working with talented and motivated high school students. He was fascinated with how much science one can do in an improvised lab without sophisticated equipment, if one has enough enthusiasm. He came back to the School as a mentor in 2008, and as an organizer in the following years (2009 - 2011). Since 2012 he is the member of Summer School of Science Organizing Committee.

                                        At the age of twelve Nino became fascinated by astronomy and joined local astronomy club 'Gea-X' Slavonski Brod (Croatia). Experimental projects he worked on there gave him a chance to learn about the scientific method and to get a closer insight into Universe. Later, as a high school student, he fell in love with computer programming. After writing his first programs (one for data encryption called 'Word Crypt' and another for epidemic simulations called 'Burning Virus'), he decided to study computer science.

                                        As a child of two mathematicians, Ivan's fascination with natural sciences was sparked off at a very early age. At first he thought chemistry would be his vocation, but during high school he started to explore the world of physics by preparing for the IYPT (International Young Physicists' Tournament).  During high school he spent most of his free time with his teammates working on experimental setups and solutions to scientific problems, which culminated in winning the first place in 2006. Physics fascinated him because it is a tool for improving the world, since physics holds the key to innovating technologies and advancing humanity. He decided to pursue his career as a physicist and is currently finishing his graduate studies at the Department of Physics at the Faculty of Science in Zagreb. His main field of interest is solid state physics. His efforts in that area earned him the Rector's Award. Lately, he has a growing interest into application of physics in environmental sciences.

He is currently finishing his undergraduate studies at the University of Zagreb and is thinking of pursuing a scientific career in cosmology or particle physics.

                                        Branko has been on the Summer School of Science since 2004, first as s participant. He immediately fell in love with the atmosphere there. What he loved the most was the fact that he finally found a place where he could meet people of similar interests and where he could ask all the questions he always wanted to ask. He has been coming back ever since, either as a technical assistant, project leader or school organizer. The School also went along with his interest in education, especially because he feels that regular schools usually don't promote critical thinking and creativity so he wants to help change that.

                                        Tomislav fell in love with chemistry under the influence of his high school chemistry teacher. Doing experiments with beautiful colours and all the other "wonders" performed in test tubes at the time teased his imagination and awoke the thirst to understand puzzles behind those experiments. This motivated him to learn more and take part in several national competitions and at the International Chemistry Olympiad where he won bronze medal. Later, interest in chemistry broadens to molecular and human biology. Interest in both people and scientific way of comprehending the world melted together for several years and resulted with a wish to become a medical doctor.

                                        Currently he is a fifth year student at School of Medicine University of Zagreb. Although educated to become a physician, his interest in basic science grew exponentially with the knowledge gained in pathophysiology of diseases. Wanting to deepen insight in molecular background of different malfunctions of the organism, Tomislav joined research labs dealing with tumour biochemistry and genetics. He also won a Rektor's prize for results on investigation of the Wnt signaling pathway's role in neuroepithelial brain tumour development. The plan for the future is to connect passion in science and medicine by doing bench-to-bedside translational research.

                                       Tomislav was a participant at Summer School of Science in 2004. S3 was to him a unique opportunity to have hands on experience in science and to be thought scientific method by experts of their fields. Great perspective acquired in Višnjan and stimulating high school education shaped his way of thinking about science as a field which combines knowledge and problem solving with creativity. Since learning science gave him the feeling of liberty, Tomislav wanted to transfer this idea further which motivated him to take part in different projects in science communication. In following years he came back to Višnjan to do workshops, then a project and finally to organize S3. He also took an active part in other popular science projects like Science Festival at School of Medicine and a workshop in Science Communication (collaboration of School of Medicine University of Zagreb and Ecole Normale Superiur Paris). Currently he moved to different aspect of science communication and now he is editing scientific section in medical students' journal Medicinar. A goal of this section is accenting importance of bridging basic science and medicine.

He is also employed as a software developer in Ericsson Nikola Tesla company in Zagreb, carrying out research activities in the field of modelling high-complex telecommunication software systems. Besides current research activities within Ericsson Nenad is also involved in other software development projects. One of the important ones was during his graduate studies where he worked on an innovative project of building the advanced software system for wild animal tracking, called Wildlife Observer. This software system will soon become a primary tool for croatian veterinarian scientists involved in the tracking of endangered animal species in Croatia, especially wolves. For this project Nenad was awarded a Rector's award in 2009. A part of this project has been used as a scientific project on Summer School of Science in 2008.

                                        Ever since his early childhood, Fran was drawn to the natural world. His curiosity was ignited by walks through nature his grandfather took him to, while telling him stories about the medicinal properties of plants, how songs of different birds sounded, or why moss grew on north side of trees.  This interest was rivaled only by the arrival of his first computer, a Commodore 64, and a book that described how to make it do mostly useless but fun things using the BASIC programming language.  With his focus shifting between biology and computers, Fran finally decided to study molecular biology. He graduated at the University of Zagreb with a diploma in bioinformatics, a young and exciting discipline at the time.

In addition to working as the only biologist in an artificial intelligence lab full of computer scientists, Fran also collaborated on various research subjects together with medical doctors, organic chemists and cancer biologists. Fran now works as a Marie Curie postdoc at the Centre de Regulaci. Genomica (CRG) in Barcelona, Spain.

Realizing how nice it would have been if such a school existed at the time when he was a high school student, he has gladly returned to the School ever since, contributing either as a lecturer, project leader or the School organizer. Even after having been there several times, Fran is still amazed by the enthusiasm for science shared between the students and the group leaders at the Summer School of Science.

Visnjan Observatory is placed among world's twelve most productive Observatories of all times.

                                       Korado continues to be active in science education and asteroid astronomy. Among his current projects are the creation of new the observatory in a near-by village Tican and the establishment of the new Science and Education Center Visnjan that cooperates internationally through the Network of Youth Excellence. In 2005, he initiated a new national science competition, VIP EUREKA, based on experimental research performed by high-school students. He provided crucial organizing support (fundraising and on-site coordination) for the Summer School of Science since it's beginning, in 2001. He is still active as a mentor at the Visnjan School of Astronomy.

                                        Branimir got interested in science after reading Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" while still attending high-school in Pozega (Croatia). His initial interest in astronomy led him to study physics in Zagreb, followed by a PhD at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. His research focused on mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes and hydrodynamic memory effects in Brownian motion, resulting in several papers in top discipline journals. After his PhD, he did postdoctoral research at French National Institute for Health and Medical Research in Paris.

He fell in love with the spirit of the place, returning regularly to recharge his batteries with enthusiasm and inspiration and to create new friendships. He was involved in the Summer School of Science since its inception in 2001, serving a number of different roles. As a School organizer since 2004, he made a series of crucial contributions to the development of the School, including conceptual design of the scientific program. He now serves as a member of the Organizing Committee and is working on School's long term development.

                                        Martina was introduced to molecular biology by one of her teachers, while still in high school in Bjelovar (Croatia). That was the time of important breakthroughs in the field, like sheep Dolly cloning and finding the cause of the "mad cow" disease. Even though she always had a strong interest in art (she has 11 years of education in music), she was so curious about what is going on in laboratories that she decided to study molecular biology.

Excited and inspired by the creative atmosphere at the School, she decided to come back as a project leader and, in 2005, as the school organizer. Together with Branimir Lukic, she enjoyed the creative process of designing the scientific program and laying down the plans for School's future growth. That included conceptualizing and finally implementing the expansion of Summer School of Science to two camps: S3 and S3++. Since 2009, Martina serves as a member of the Summer School of Science Organizing Committee and is focused on School's long-term development.

                                        Monika gave more serious thought on going into science after participating in Summer School of Science in Požega in 2013. Before that she had many interests, the biggest being music. She went to Music School and planned on going to Music Academy. Few months before the end of high school she had a change of heart and chose to study Mathematics at Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Zagreb. What she loves the most about Math is the purity that comes with proofs and beauty that emerges from a human mind when an idea for solving a particular problem occurs.

                                        My story with science has started a long time ago when I was still a child, I just haven't known that then. As I learned to count I started to look for patterns around me, in licence plates, tiles, really everywhere you can look I could find a mystery of numbers and shapes, and I still enjoy a good mystery series or novel. As I grow up I found out that science is a grate tool for solving mysteries and put your curiosity in a good use, and that is how I decided to become an engineer. So, I am now a student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb, and studying to become an electrical engineer.

                                        I joined the Summer School of Science family as a participant in summer of 2013, and after that I just knew I have to come back. So two years later, as I just finished my first year in college, I came back as a Swapshop leader. It was a great experience, everyone was so friendly, enthusiastic and creative and the atmosphere was even better then I remembered. From there my motivation for teaching and promoting science just grew, I became more active in college where I am a demonstrator in several classes and I volunteered at Night of Science. When I was offered a place as a technical assistant at this year's Summer school I jumped right in, and was ready for a new challenge and lots of new great people to share this experience with.

Later, he became more interested in evolutionary biology and medicine thanks to his high school teacher who encouraged him to do his own research. It all resulted in different individual and joint (Croatian Institute for Public Health, Croatian Academy of Science and Arts Pozega...) interdisciplinary projects. He has published a paleodemographical roundup of an archeological site near Pozega and is planing to pursue similar ideas. Apart from the natural sciences, Tonko likes to experiment with social sciences such as sociology. He finds interdisciplinarity as an only way to improve one's knowledge and outside-the-box thinking.
