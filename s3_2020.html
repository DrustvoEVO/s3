                        </h3>

                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2020/Ana_project.jpg" width="270" hspace="9" align="right" />
                        Today it is common knowledge that our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy and that the universe is filled with many other galaxies. However, merely a hundred years ago this was unknown and represented the hot topic of astrophysics. Just like we once thought that all the planets revolve around the Earth, a century ago the Sun was thought to be the centre of the universe. In the first half of the 20th century, the research of an american astronomer Harlow Shapely showed a different picture of the universe. He searched for the centre of the Milky Way by studying large groups of stars called globular clusters. Thanks to him, we now know that our Sun is just one of billions of stars in our galaxy and that it is not close to the centre of the Milky Way, but on the very edge of it.

                        </p>

                        <p class="project">Globular clusters are nearly spherical groups of stars that can be found orbiting the center of most galaxies. The average age of globular clusters is around 10 to 14 billion years, which makes them some of the oldest objects in the universe. As such, they can teach us not only about the universe today, but also about the universe in the past. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">This research project will introduce you to real-life scientific work of astrophysicists. You will use computers to handle data collected by some of the greatest telescopes of our age and you will get a chance to find the stars you are researching on the sky above Požega. We will explore our galaxy through its clusters: we will find out how many of them are there, how they are distributed in the Milky Way, how old they are and if they are similar to globular clusters in other galaxies. Answering these questions will make it possible for you to ask new questions, expand your knowledge and reach our ultimate goal - finding the centre of the Milky Way!</p>

                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2020/SS_project.jpg"  height="170" hspace="9" align="right" />What is a bio-logic? If someone has diabetes because their body does not produce enough of the hormone insulin, the simplest treatment is to just give insulin to the person. It sounds like simple logic, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, that is where the simplicity ends. Biologically derived molecules, also called biologics, like insulin, antibodies, and vaccines are such complex molecules that they cannot be synthesized chemically. Did you know, only 40 years ago, people with diabetes were treated with insulin that was derived from the pancreas of animals like cattle, pigs and dogs! Nowadays we have much better ways of producing large amounts of biologics. Scientists have cracked this bio-logic problem by using some clever bioengineering to convince simple microorganisms to be our allies in (bio-logic-ally!) producing these biologics for us.</p>

                        <p class="project">In this project we will be hijacking our own bacteria to produce some interesting biomolecules. One of these biomolecules even glows under UV light! We will hack into the genetic code of bacteria to engineer it to produce our protein of choice. Next, we will test what are the best conditions that keep our bacteria happy to produce large amounts of this biomolecule. We will finally extract and purify the biomolecule and check its activity to ensure it is of a high-quality. If you want to learn how to make your own personal biomolecule, join this project and become a biologically inspired engineer!</p>

                    </h3>
                         <p class="project"><img src="img/2020/MJ_project.png"  height="170" hspace="9" align="right" />Have you recently talked to a computer? Ever asked a digital assistant to tell you a joke, or to navigate you home, or asked for a translation of the menu in the restaurant abroad? You’ll probably have noticed that computers have made some progress in understanding human language, but they still can’t do as well as other humans. We want to find out what the difference is between a human’s and a computer’s brain and how they process and represent language. 
                         </br><i>The mind</i>: By recording the activity of different parts of brain while a human listens to speech, we can learn how the brain processes language. This allows us to explain e.g. why learning a new language is easy when we are young, but gets harder when we get older. 
                        </br><i>The machine</i>: The main ingredients for Artificial Intelligence (AI) are neural networks and machine learning algorithms. With those, computers can learn how to represent words in a context, how to interpret a spoken signal, and how to translate.</p>

                        <p class="project"><strong>Mental representation of words (project leader: Mirta Zelenika):</strong> Our goal will be to find out how the language is processed in our brain. In order to do that, we will learn how to use an EEG to record mental activity. This will not be an easy job: EEG records a lot of noise, so a big challenge will be to find the signal in that noise. Once we find the signal, we will be able to explain how our brain knows the difference between speech sounds and some other sounds.</p>
                    

                    <p class="project"><strong>Language processing with machine learning (project leader: Julia Kreutzer): </strong> In this project, our goal will be to teach computers how to understand human language. In order to do this, we will use machine learning, a special family of algorithms that allow us to train computers for arbitrary tasks. For example, we can teach a machine to generate jokes, by showing it many examples of funny jokes. In particular, we will focus on artificial neural networks, which were inspired by the architecture of the brain. The final goal will be to teach a computer how to translate between languages - build our own translator!</p>

Although they are by definition invisible to the naked eye, there are far more microbes on earth than any other forms of life and they have been around for billions of years before the advent of multicellular life. We are born, we live, and we die in their world. It is unfortunate that we typically hear bad things about them when microbes cause disease (think of the latest coronavirus outbreak in China), because the truth is that the vast majority of them are harmless to us humans.. and many are actually extremely beneficial. Did you know for example that many of the finer foods that we enjoy would not exist if it was not for the help of our little friends - the microbes?
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">To uncover them, we will explore the local markets to find common food staples and discuss these armies of microbial little helpers that make them so tasty and fluffy. ​Bread, kéfir, and yogurt are all examples of food that we'll investigate and where microbes play a key role. We will see that sometimes these little helpers are actually communities of different microbial species that work in team to ferment the food to our advantage. Also, as you have all probably “suffered” before, some microbes spoil our food or make it impossible to be in the same room as them due to their horrific smell. So, our exploration would be incomplete if we did not discuss those nasty critters too. 
                        </p>

                          <p class="project">In this project we will learn about these microscopic organisms, where they fit on the tree of life, and start hunting for them in the various foods that we enjoy. We will use a set of laboratory techniques from the field of microbiology and molecular biology, and will take a dive into the field of bioinformatics and sequencing technologies to investigate the genomics of the various microbes we encounter.

                        Imagine a very advanced alien civilization, observing the universe for the past million years or so. Our tiny rock we call home does not interest them that much. After all, the dominant life-form on this blue planet, some monkeys that recently started to wear shoes, has not even entered into interstellar contact. Because of this, the alien scientists are rather brief when it comes to us, their three-word summary of humanity on planet earth reads as follows: hunting - farming - factories. Now, I’d like to your draw attention to the duration of these periods: it took about 50.000 years before people got tired of running after their food. Then, it took another 10.000 years of farming until the industrial revolution 200 years ago changed the world once again, more or less to the state it is in today. Even the aliens, however unimpressed they may be, cannot deny that our progress is at least <i>accelerating</i> dramatically.
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">Why is this? Well, it is certainly <i>not</i> because humans now are inherently smarter or more skilled than their ancestors. For example, the ancient Greeks did absolutely brilliant mathematics but they also never managed to build a toaster. The true driving force behind this spectacular acceleration is information. Our ability to transfer information over time and space has grown tremendously. Book printing and the internet are two major milestones in this regard. This means knowledge became available to more people, faster, which in turn meant that more knowledge and new ideas were generated faster, which also got transferred faster, and so on. This self-amplifying process is what drives humankind’s ever faster progress.
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">This project is a testimony to that central point. Based on knowledge freely available on the internet, an intelligent teenager today is perfectly capable of completely understanding all the maths, physics, engineering and computer science necessary for building an autonomous robot. Concretely, the end goal of this project is a miniature self-driving car that learns to drive itself around a track, based solely on images it recorded by its own camera. In order to do so, we’ll have a look at 17<sup>th</sup> century maths (basic calculus), 19<sup>th</sup> century physics (electricity & magnetism) and lastly, 21<sup>st</sup> century computer science (artificial intelligence). Also, we’ll build this thing for real using a raspberry pi, which means we should know a thing or two about practical engineering. Such an effort of collecting, sharing, using, and improving knowledge is the core of that what we call science. Not even 15 years ago, this project would have been borderline impossible, today all you need is a curious mind, an internet connection and (perhaps) some minor guidance, all of which are in ample supply in Požega.</p>

                        How does a path of becoming a scientist look like? Which univeristy to choose and how do the study programs look like? How important is it to move across the borders of your home country for educational purposes, and at which point to do it? How does an everyday life of a scientist look like?
                        <br><br>
                        Inspired by the questions of our former participants, this round table aims to introduce you to the complex world of higher education one has to go through in order to become a scientist. Project leaders and organizers will share their unique scientific stories and experiences, as well as tackle all the questions you may have about your future studies and scientific career steps, hoping that having this expanded view on the scientific world will make it easier for you to make future choices.
