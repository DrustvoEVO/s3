								<p class ="main2">This year we will have the honor to host a lecture by Prof. Dr. Arnold Benz.</p>

								<p class="main2">Arnold Benz studied physics at ETH Zurich. After gaining his Master degree, he did his Ph.D. at Cornell University, NY, USA, with Thomas Gold on the acceleration of the solar wind. In 1972, he moved back to ETH where he was appointed professor in 1993. His interdisciplinary work on science and religion was awarded by an honorary doctor of the University of Zurich.</p>

								<p class="main2">He was president of Division II (Sun and Heliosphere) of the International Astronomical Union, president of Commission 10 (Solar Activity) of the IAU, president of the Swiss Society for Astrophysics and Astronomy, and a member of several more national and international committees.
His achievements include the first detailed survey and interpretation of solar flare radio emissions in decimeter radio waves, theory for particle acceleration in flares, and the relation of thermal X-ray and non-thermal X-ray emissions of solar and stellar activity.Present research focuses on star and planet formation using data of the Herschel Space Observatory and on high-energy diagnostics of solar flares. The latter is connected to the involvement as a Senior Advisor in the STIX project on Solar Orbiter at the FHNW in Windisch.

								<p class ="main2">This year’s edition of the Summer School will have the privilege to host <b>Andrea Brunello</b>, the director of the <b>Jet Propulsion Theatre</b>!</p>

                                <p class="main2">After studying physics and mathematics at Cornell University and obtaining a PhD from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Andrea decided to pursue a professional theatre career. As the director of Jet Propulsion Theatre, a project that <b>narrates science by the means of theatre</b>, he is engaged into inspiring the audience and enriching their scientific knowledge. His aim is to allow people to understand science and the people of science in a whole new way, by developing a sense on curiosity and wonder. As a play-writer,  he has written and performed several plays all over the world. His plays touch upon the most advanced topics in science and make them reachable to anyone. His play <b>“The Principle of Uncertainty”</b> talks about the wonders of quantum mechanics, while his other plays talk about time (<b>“Taking Out Grandpa”</b>) and space travel (<b>“Pale Blue Dot”</b>).</p>

                                <p class="main2">During his stay in Požega, he will hold a workshops about Storytelling techniques in science. Interested in this amazing workshop? <a href="apply.html"><strong>Apply now</strong></a>!</p>
