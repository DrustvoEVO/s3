In 1972, he moved back to ETH where he was appointed professor in 1993. His interdisciplinary work on science and religion was awarded by an honorary doctor of the University of Zurich.</p>

								<p class="main2">He was president of Division II (Sun and Heliosphere) of the International Astronomical Union, president of Commission 10 (Solar Activity) of the IAU, president of the Swiss Society for Astrophysics and Astronomy, and a member of several more national and international committees.
His achievements include the first detailed survey and interpretation of solar flare radio emissions in decimeter radio waves, theory for particle acceleration in flares, and the relation of thermal X-ray and non-thermal X-ray emissions of solar and stellar activity.Present research focuses on star and planet formation using data of the Herschel Space Observatory and on high-energy diagnostics of solar flares. The latter is connected to the involvement as a Senior Advisor in the STIX project on Solar Orbiter at the FHNW in Windisch.

                    			<p class="main2">Our S3 organizers are always very busy making everything go as smooth as possible. That’s why the <a href="people.html#currenttech"><strong>technical assistants</strong></a> are here to give them a hand! In 2017, these roles will be taken by Dora Grbavac (S3 camp) and Monika Majstorović (S3++ camp), both ex-participants and swapshop leaders. </p>

                                <p class="main2">We are happy to announce that the S3++ camp this year will be held from July 28th until August 6th. It is going to be orchestrated by <a href="people.html"><strong>"team Zurich"</strong></a> - Matija Žeško and Petra Krznar, PhD students from ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Petra already organized the School twice (2013 and 2015) and Matija is a new addition to the S3 team. However, both are eager to make this School a great experience for everyone.</p>

                                <p class="main2">As this is the fifth edition of the Summer School of Science in Požega, we are preparing interesting projects and lectures to help shape a new generation of young scientists. Stay tuned for more information!</p>
