                            Mutations happen all the time – they are drivers of evolution, and most are benign or meaningless. However, we all know that mutations can cause serious issues. Cancer is one such disease, and a leading cause of death worldwide. Therefore, substantial collective efforts are taken to improve our understanding of the disease and to develop new means of prevention, detection, and treatment. Cancers arise from normal cells in our bodies and, based on the affected tissue, can be divided into different types. One type of cancer is melanoma, the most dangerous kind of skin cancer, which arises from a malignant transformation of pigmented cells in the skin, melanocytes.
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">
                            In this project, we will explore what it is about cancer cells that distinguishes them from normal cells and makes cancer so deadly. Using melanoma as an example, we will learn how to approach questions in the field. We will discuss the importance of preclinical models in cancer research and the available methods of testing our hypothesis. During this project, to enable us to test our hypothesis,  you will get first-hand experience with standard experimental methods in molecular biology. Specifically, we will learn how to extract ribonucleic acid (RNA) from melanoma cells and test the expression of our gene of interest using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques. Finally, we will assess the role of that gene on melanoma tumor growth in an in silico (computer-based) experiment.

                            Ah, viruses, the one topic we all learned about over the past couple of years. But did you know that not all viruses are our enemies? I’m talking about phages: viruses that infect and kill bacteria, but do no harm to humans. These phages are very interesting, and we can learn a lot from them. We could ask: how do they fight bacteria? Can we use the same mechanisms as a new therapy? Or use the phages as a whole in treatments? Especially in times like these, with a strong rise in multi-drug resistant bacteria, this type of research is highly relevant. But how well do we know phages, and how can we get to know them even better?
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">
                            In this bioinformatics project, we will zoom in on multiple snippets of DNA encoded by a phage. We will try to decipher the function of these pieces, so that we can learn more about this phage. First, we will look at what we can learn from the DNA itself. Then, we will focus on the protein encoded on this piece of DNA. For that, we will use our computational microscope: a new algorithm that allows us to predict the shape of a protein. You will get familiar with many new bioinformatics tools, learn about the power of good visualization and do some coding. You will also gain insight into viruses and molecular biology.

                            Rapid economic development is followed by the development of the textile industry. A great problem of today, which is well known, but not properly addressed, is the increasing amount of wastewaters being released into the environment. Synthetic dyes, which those wastewaters contain, can be toxic for both aquatic organisms and humans. Today, there are many known wastewater treatment techniques. However, the development of more efficient and cost-effective methods is still in progress. Another huge problem is biological waste produced in industry, such as the beer industry. There are large amounts of brewer’s yeast which are, after a certain time, being disclaimed as waste.

Then, we will use brewer’s yeast, unusable for the beer industry, to remove these toxic dyes from previously prepared wastewater.

                            Astronomical spectroscopy is the study of astronomy using the techniques of spectroscopy to measure the amplitude of electromagnetic radiation in a set of frequencies - including visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray, infrared, and radio waves – coming from stars and other celestial objects. Specifically, stellar spectra can reveal many properties of stars, such as their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, brightness, or distance from Earth. This irradiance by stars can be used as an example of two physical phenomena relating to the quantized nature of energy: black-body radiation and spectral lines. The former behavior is described by Planck’s law, whereas the latter is explained by the photoelectric effect, for which Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize. Thanks to stellar irradiance, we know how heavy elements are generated from lighter ones in a nuclear process known as fusion. Moreover, stars also allowed us to deduce that the universe is expanding, which we observe as redshift from the stars in other galaxies.

                        <p class="project">
                            In this project, we will write a computer program in Python that automatically finds the surface temperature of a star and the elements it is made of, using stellar irradiance data as the input. Our aim in this project is to get a general idea of the quantized nature of the universe, as well as the importance of the concept of frequency in understanding it. Moreover, we will compare our theoretical predictions to the data using fundamental machine learning techniques, mainly so-called linear regression.

                            Artificial intelligence has surged in popularity in the last decade. It can be found in almost any computer, from the smallest (your cellphone) to the largest (Google). This increase in popularity can be attributed to several things, such as an increase in available computational power, simple yet flexible algorithms to teach artificial intelligence, and the availability of huge amounts of data to do so. But above all is the fact that artificial intelligence tends to outperform people at specific tasks, and those tasks are getting more and more complex as the field progresses. That is why it is expected that computers will be driving cars in the near future, not only reducing human-caused accidents but also reducing traffic congestion and increasing fuel efficiency.
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">
                            The goal of this project is to put these expectations to the test with a simple model of a car, its surroundings, and the artificial intelligence that will drive it. We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the model, implement it, and train a neural network to drive the car in different traffic conditions and obstacle paths. We will test the performance of different neural network architectures to see how they might outperform human drivers. Finally, we will test the possibility of using only one neural network to conduct all traffic and see if this significantly improves upon the results of individual artificial intelligences.

                                   When we think about our emotions, we can probably imagine how we can feel various emotions in the same day – from sadness, anger and boredom to excitement, happiness and interest. Likewise, when we look at our mood during the week, we could say that on some days we generally feel better and on some days we feel worse. Psychological studies show that the rhythm of our mood varies during the week and during the day in a sinusoidal manner. <br><br>In this workshop we will measure our mood during one week by filling out a short mood questionnaire called PANAS. We will use the obtained data to conduct sinusoidal regression, which we will use to try to detect our own daily and weekly mood rhythms. We will compare our data to the data of previous studies on this topic.<br/><br/>

                                   Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star in the constellation of Orion and it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, usually sitting comfortably among the top ten brightest we can see. However, in late 2019 and early 2020, its brightness started to drop steeply and seemingly for no reason. At its dimmest, it dropped outside the top 20 on the list of brightest stars. This unprecedented dimming brought about a range of discussions about its cause, including talk of a potential supernova.<br><br>
                                    In this swapshop, we will explore stellar evolution and astronomical methods for measuring the temperature, size and composition of stars. We will use this information and data collected during Betelgeuse’s dimming to discuss possible (and probable) causes and decide whether we should worry about Orion’s shoulder going <i>boom</i>.<br/><br/>

                                   The crazy notion of cutting and opening an organism's body was considered madness in the past, but today is a go-to scientific method in studying internal anatomy and physiology of creatures. Through shapes of different organs, tissues and body parts we can observe and learn incredible amounts of information about animals’ behavior, diet, ways of reproducing and habitat they live in. Through internal anatomy scientists can analyze adaptations of organs and organ systems through different species on an evolutionary tree, providing them with deeper understanding of ways body works. Getting the technique right in the beginning allows biologists to use this method in different situations and adapt to different species. <br><br>
                                   We will play a role of crazy scientists and dissect some insects, worms and some other animals to observe their anatomy and physiology. We will learn how to prepare, put to sleep, dissect specimens under principles of bioethics. Information that we get from our specimens will be used to observe development of certain organ systems through the evolutionary tree. We will also learn about different adaptations some organisms have. This swapshop will provide students with experience in using different tools and appliances found in a lab, dealing with complex topics in easy ways and most importantly improvisation.<br/><br/>

How can we isolate it from a cell? How can we confirm the presence of DNA molecule in a tube? What are the questions we can ask and what answers can we get from reading sequences or from other analyses with this molecule? Can we multiple our sample and why managing that would be important for us too?<br><br>
									Workshop participants will have the opportunity to isolate DNA from bacterial cells. We will visualize our samples and see how DNA can become a simple strip on an agarose gel with the help of an electric field. Through discussion, we will get to know the basics of a PCR reaction and why it is revolutionary. Using bioinformatics tools, we are going to design some of the components needed for PCR reaction. Finally, with the help of computer simulation, we will go through all the steps and discover our results.<br/><br/>

                                   Electricity is one of those things taken for granted these days, along with household appliances, but have you ever wondered what makes this system work? Surely you have seen pictures of old windmills and water wheel mills designed to harness the power of wind or water and use it to perform work, and this is actually exactly the same as the way we produce electricity nowadays. In fact, what makes all your appliances run is the power of a river (or a heated steam stream) pushing against a turbine somewhere far away. In this workshop we will build a primitive electric generator and an electric motor and examine the way they work to see up close the process so ubiquitous in our everyday lives. Through discussion we will recreate the thought that went into designing various household appliances and see the many ways to use electric power. We will also get creative on the turbine-spinning side of the system and show how many different ways there are to get a wheel spinning.<br/><br/>
