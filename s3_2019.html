                        Self-driving cars are no longer the stuff of science-fiction. This idea is being developed all over the world because many believe that, in principle, all the necessary ingredients are available to make them a reality. This is transformational technology, where robotics, artificial intelligence, software engineering, physics and mechanical engineering meet. If this effort is successful, it stands a good chance to be one of the defining technological breakthroughs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and change the world we live in.
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">There is no better way to understand something than just going out and doing it yourself, which also happens to be exactly what we will do. We will use a raspberry pi (a basic, tiny computer) and try to put wheels under it so the computer can drive itself around a track, using only a camera. This will be a big challenge, involving:
                         <br/>
                        + <strong>Engineering</strong>: the car, the camera and the computer are all components of the eventual self-driving car. We will need to figure out how to best build that single machine.
                         <br/>
                        + <strong>Software</strong>: Putting all the components together does not only need to happen in the physical world, it also needs to happen inside the "brain" of the car, which would be the computer. We will design the software that makes this happen.
 						<br/>
						+ <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: our computer needs to be "intelligent", capable of getting camera-images as inputs and figure out what they mean to stay on track. This will be a challenge in its own right, apart from the software part.
							 <br/> <br/>
						The end-goal of this project is a miniature self-driving car that can drive itself around a track without human intervention.

                    </h3>
                    
                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2019/Nicoleta_project.jpg" width="220"  hspace="9" align="right" />
                    Here is a quick trivia question: is the use of animal experiments sufficiently reliable and relevant to trust our everyday products are safe? 
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">Ranging from antiperspirants, fragrances, make-up and shampoos, to soaps, sunscreens and toothpastes, cosmetics and personal care products play an essential role in all parts of our lives. However, this means we are repeatedly exposed to their ingredients for long periods of time. Users of these products need to know that the ingredients – mixtures of man-made and natural chemicals are safe. Historically, details about the harmful effects of chemicals have come from testing them on animals. Despite providing potentially valuable information, especially for “vanity products” such as cosmetics, there is a move against testing on animals due to the potential harm and suffering it causes to these species. As a result, the European Union banned the testing of cosmetics ingredients in animals from March, 2013. Without being able to use animals, there is a much greater need of alternative methods, which could provide a better understanding of the potential adverse effects of chemicals on humans, and ultimately benefit everyone. 
                        </p>

                          <p class="project">In this project, we will learn how new cosmetic ingredients could be assessed in the European Union without the use of animal tests by analysing the labels of personal care products. We will explore the role of the Three Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) in animal experiments and the existing alternative methods to animal testing. We will apply these principles to cosmetics ingredients using a freely available database of information on harmful effects as well as computer models such as machine learning that allow us to predict potential harmful effects from chemical structure and without the need for testing.
                        </p>

                    </h3>
                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2019/Mladena_project.jpg"  height="155" hspace="9" align="right" />If you were asked to name of one important large molecule that you carry in your cells, your answer would most likely be “DNA”. Indeed, this bearer of genetic information is by far the most famous biological molecule. However, it is less known that almost all functions in cell, such as transport of small molecules (e.g. water) and immune protection, rely on an entirely different set of molecules – proteins. While DNA is made of four nucleotides (A, C, G, T) and has a unique shape, proteins are built using twenty different forms (amino acids). The human body produces a part of amino acids, however some of them can’t be produces and instead must be taken by food.  Deficiency of some amino acids can lead to development of serious diseases, which are related with growth problems, hair loss, walking problems, etc. To investigate and solve the problems related to proteins, peptides (common name for short proteins) and amino acids, we don’t have to rely on the Nature. Instead, the chemists can prepare all these structures in the lab. 

                        </p>

                        <p class="project"> In this chemistry project, we will try to answer how reactions that Nature does very easily can be prepared or even improved in a flask. You will learn about techniques for detecting and characterizing amino acids and peptides, as well as methods for isolation of amino acids from natural sources. You will become familiar with and make models of amino acids, do chemical synthesis in a lab and finally learn how determining the structure of the synthesized molecules is much like solving the puzzle consisting of spectroscopy data (mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance) in our case.

                    </h3>
                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2019/Alex_Seb_project.jpeg"  height="240" hspace="9" align="right" />Every one of us makes a billion decisions every day. Should I turn right or left here? Should I eat my snack now or save it for later? Some of the decisions we make require knowledge obtained through many years of studying, while others are simply based on our senses and intuition. Some decisions we make unconsiously and fast, while others require days and weeks of preparations. How do people make such decisions is a mystery that fascinated scientists for centuries, from philosopher Renee Descartes to the Nobel-prize laureatee cognitive scientist Daniel Kahneman. Answering this question requires an effort from various scientific fields, including neuroscience, cognitive science and computer science. <br/><br/>
						A great polygon to study how humans make decisions are video games: they allow us to quickly analyse large quantities of decisions and adapt the scenario on demand. To better understand how humans make decisions, the following two projects will investigate the problem from two different perspectives - neuroscience and artificial intelligence - by means of video games.</p>

                        <p class="project"><strong>Decoding the human brain (project leader: Alexandre Kempf):</strong>: In this project, the participants will learn the basics of neuroscience and study the cognitive functions in human brain. Our main tool to peak insight the brain will be EEG measurements - a popular method to study cognitive functions. We will explain and analyse the pros and cons of most of the techniques used in neurosciences, and will dive into the numerous signals the brain emits. The final goal of the project will be to play the game of "Breakout" through an brain-computer interface realised by EEG: the player will be able to play the game by performing some mental activity instead of using a keyboard. To achieve this, we will need some help from computer science. In short: It's going to be a lot of fun!</p>
                    

                    <p class="project"><strong>Mimicking the brain (project leader: Sebastijan Dumančić):</strong>: In this project, we will reverse-engineer the process of human decision making. We will develop an artificially intelligence agent, a computer program, that plays the game of "Breakout". We will pay the special attention to modelling the process of learning - instead of programming every possible situation an agent can experience, we will give it ability to learn from the demonstrations. In order to do so, we will have to collect a large collection of demonstration how to play the game and develop a mathematical model of how we, humans, learn. The main challenge will be to boil down the learning ability to an algorithm a compter can execute. In short: it's going to be super fun!</p>

                     </h3>
                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2019/Rose_project.jpg" width="340" hspace="9" align="right" />
                       As a byproduct of stress, unhealthy eating habits, and exposure to pollution and other toxic substances, waste molecules are produced by the cells inside our body. These molecules are called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) - they are very unstable and in order to become stable they start reacting to other molecules in the cell, including the DNA. If left unchecked, these molecules can contribute to the development of chronic diseases, heart disease, cancer immune deficiency and Parkinson disease, but most importantly they speed up the process of aging. Luckily for us, we have anti-oxidants to save the day! Anti-oxidants are substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells caused by ROS by binding to them and stabilizing them. Examples of these are vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotenes. Most organisms have their own internal factories of anti-oxidants, but majority of the anti-oxidants we use actually come from our food, especially from plant-based sources such as fruits and vegetables.

                        </p>

                        <p class="project">In this project we will get to not only create anti-oxidant super organism, but to also see the impact of these on the survival. Using genetic modification methodologies, we will create a specie that will express high levels of anti-oxidants, we will test its ability to survive and compare it to the non-genetically modified specie that does not possess this special super power. During this project we will learn a great deal about genes, how they work, their function and genes expression and use that to design gene sequences. In addition, we will learn to build our own scientific equipment and machines using simple everyday things. Finally, we will learn how to think critically and scientifically, pose research questions and test different hypothesis. The findings of this project will be transferred to our everyday life, where we learn about healthy eating and how we can help our bodies by reducing the production of oxidative stress.

                                A regular visitor to observatories in the Atacama desert, <a href="http://www.amaurytriaud.net"><strong>Dr Amaury Triaud</strong></a> is the discoverer of over one hundred <strong>exoplanets</strong> (planets which orbit stars other than the Sun). His research concentrates on extracting empirical evidence about the physical processes that lead to the formation and evolution of planets. His main attention is on discovering and investigating planetary systems that are different to our own, either by the type of planets that compose those systems, by their architectures, or because of the type of star(s) they orbit.
								<br>Dr Triaud's current attention focuses on circumbinary planets (planets with two suns), and on identifying planets that have sizes and temperatures similar to Earth, and that orbit around the smallest stars in our Galaxy. As part of the SPECULOOS collaboration, he is a co-discoverer of the <a href="http://www.trappist.one/"><strong>TRAPPIST-1 system</strong></a>, whose planets are most optimal in the search for evidence of biology beyond our Solar system.
